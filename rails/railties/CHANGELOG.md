*   Defer route drawing to the first request, or when url_helpers are called

    Executes the first routes reload in middleware, or when a route set's
    url_helpers receives a route call / asked if it responds to a route.
    Previously, this was executed unconditionally on boot, which can
    slow down boot time unnecessarily for larger apps with lots of routes.

*   Add Rubocop and GitHub Actions to plugin generator.
    This can be skipped using --skip-rubocop and --skip-ci.
