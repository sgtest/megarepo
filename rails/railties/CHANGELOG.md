*   Raise `ArgumentError` when reading `config.x.something` with arguments

    ```ruby
    config.x.this_works.this_raises true # raises ArgumentError
    ```

    *Sean Doyle*

*   Add default PWA files for manifest and service-worker that are served from `app/views/pwa` and can be dynamically rendered through erb. Mount these files explicitly at the root with default routes in the generated routes file.

    *DHH*

*   Updated system tests to now use headless Chrome by default for the new applications.

    *DHH*

*   Add GitHub CI files for dependabot, brakeman, rubocop, and running tests by default. Can be skipped with --skip-ci.

    *DHH*

*   Add brakeman gem by default for static analysis of security vulnerabilities. Allow skipping with --skip-brakeman option.

    *vipulnsward*

*   Add RuboCop with rules from rubocop-rails-omakase by default. Skip with --skip-rubocop.

    *DHH* and *zzak*

*   Use `bin/rails runner --skip-executor` option to not wrap the runner script
    with an Executor.

    *Ben Sheldon*

*   Fix isolated engines to take `ActiveRecord::Base.table_name_prefix` into consideration.
    This will allow for engine defined models, such as inside Active Storage, to respect
    Active Record table name prefix configuration.

    *Chedli Bourguiba*

*   Fix running `db:system:change` when app has no Dockerfile.

    *Hartley McGuire*

*   In Action Mailer previews, list inline attachments separately from normal
    attachments. For example, attachments that were previously listed like

      > Attachments: logo.png file1.pdf file2.pdf

    will now be listed like

      > Attachments: file1.pdf file2.pdf (Inline: logo.png)

    *Christian Schmidt* and *Jonathan Hefner*

*   In mailer preview, only show SMTP-To if it differs from the union of To, Cc and Bcc.

    *Christian Schmidt*

*   Enable YJIT by default on new applications running Ruby 3.3+

    Adds a `config/initializers/enable_yjit.rb` initializer that enables YJIT
    when running on Ruby 3.3+.

    *Jean Boussier*

*   In Action Mailer previews, show date from message `Date` header if present.

    *Sampat Badhe*

*   Exit with non-zero status when the migration generator fails.

    *Katsuhiko YOSHIDA*

*   Use numeric UID and GID in Dockerfile template

    The Dockerfile generated by `rails new` sets the default user and group
    by name instead of UID:GID. This can cause the following error in kubernetes:

    ```
    container has runAsNonRoot and image has non-numeric user (rails), cannot verify user is non-root
    ```

    This change sets default user and group by their numeric values.

    *Ivan Fedotov*

*   Disallow invalid values for rails new options.

    The `--database`, `--asset-pipeline`, `--css`, and `--javascript` flags for
    `rails new` can all take different options. This change adds checks to
    options to make sure the user enters the correct value.

    *Tony Drake*, *Akhil G Krishnan*, *Petrik de Heus*

*   Conditionally print `$stdout` when invoking `run_generator`

    In an effort to improve the developer experience when debugging
    generator tests, we add the ability to conditionally print `$stdout`
    instead of capturing it.

    This allows for calls to `binding.irb` and `puts` work as expected.

    ```sh
    RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT=true ./bin/test test/generators/actions_test.rb
    ```

    *Steve Polito*

*   Remove the option `config.public_file_server.enabled` from the generators
    for all environments, as the value is the same in all environments.

    *Adrian Hirt*
