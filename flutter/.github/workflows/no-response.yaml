            Without additional information, we are unfortunately not sure how to
            resolve this issue. We are therefore reluctantly going to close this
            bug for now.

            If you find this problem please file a new issue with the same description,
            what happens, logs and the output of 'flutter doctor -v'. All system setups
            can be slightly different so it's always better to open new issues and reference
            the related ones.

            Thanks for your contribution.
