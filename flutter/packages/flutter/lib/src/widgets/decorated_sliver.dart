/// A sliver widget that paints a [Decoration] either before or after its child
/// paints.
///
/// Unlike [DecoratedBox], this widget expects its child to be a sliver, and
/// must be placed in a widget that expects a sliver.
///
/// If the child sliver has infinite [SliverGeometry.scrollExtent], then we only
/// draw the decoration down to the bottom [SliverGeometry.cacheExtent], and
/// it is necessary to ensure that the bottom border does not creep
/// above the top of the bottom cache. This can happen if the bottom has a
/// border radius larger than the extent of the cache area.
///
/// Commonly used with [BoxDecoration].
///
/// The [child] is not clipped. To clip a child to the shape of a particular
/// [ShapeDecoration], consider using a [ClipPath] widget.
///
