Git v2.44 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features

 * "git add" and "git stash" learned to support the ":(attr:...)"
   magic pathspec.

 * "git rebase --autosquash" is now enabled for non-interactive rebase,
   but it is still incompatible with the apply backend.

 * Introduce "git replay", a tool meant on the server side without
   working tree to recreate a history.

 * "git merge-file" learned to take the "--diff-algorithm" option to
   use algorithm different from the default "myers" diff.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * Process to add some form of low-level unit tests has started.

 * Add support for GitLab CI.

 * "git for-each-ref --no-sort" still sorted the refs alphabetically
   which paid non-trivial cost.  It has been redefined to show output
   in an unspecified order, to allow certain optimizations to take
   advantage of.

 * Simplify API implementation to delete references by eliminating
   duplication.

 * Subject approxidate() and show_date() machinery to OSS-Fuzz.


Fixes since v2.43
-----------------

 * The way CI testing used "prove" could lead to running the test
   suite twice needlessly, which has been corrected.
   (merge e7e03ef995 js/ci-discard-prove-state later to maint).

 * Update ref-related tests.

 * "git format-patch --encode-email-headers" ignored the option when
   preparing the cover letter, which has been corrected.

 * Newer versions of Getopt::Long started giving warnings against our
   (ab)use of it in "git send-email".  Bump the minimum version
   requirement for Perl to 5.8.1 (from September 2002) to allow
   simplifying our implementation.
   (merge 6ff658cc78 tz/send-email-negatable-options later to maint).

 * Earlier we stopped relying on commit-graph that (still) records
   information about commits that are lost from the object store,
   which has negative performance implications.  The default has been
   flipped to disable this pessimization.
   (merge b1df3b3867 ps/commit-graph-less-paranoid later to maint).

 * Stale URLs have been updated to their current counterparts (or
   archive.org) and HTTP links are replaced with working HTTPS links.
   (merge 62b4f7b9c6 js/update-urls-in-doc-and-comment later to maint).

 * trace2 streams used to record the URLs that potentially embed
   authentication material, which has been corrected.
   (merge 16fa3eebc0 jh/trace2-redact-auth later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge 50f1abcff6 js/packfile-h-typofix later to maint).
   (merge cbf498eb53 jb/reflog-expire-delete-dry-run-options later to maint).
   (merge 7854bf4960 rs/i18n-cannot-be-used-together later to maint).
   (merge cd3c28c53a rs/column-leakfix later to maint).
