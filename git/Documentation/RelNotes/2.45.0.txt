Git v2.45 Release Notes
=======================

Backward Compatibility Notes

UI, Workflows & Features

 * Integrate the reftable code into the refs framework as a backend.
   With "git init --ref-format=reftable", hopefully it would be a lot
   more efficient to manage a repository with many references.

 * "git checkout -p" and friends learned that that "@" is a synonym
   for "HEAD".

 * Variants of vimdiff learned to honor mergetool.<variant>.layout
   settings.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * The code to iterate over refs with the reftable backend has seen
   some optimization.

 * More tests that are marked as "ref-files only" have been updated to
   improve test coverage of reftable backend.

 * Some parts of command line completion script (in contrib/) have
   been micro-optimized.


Fixes since v2.44
-----------------

 * "git apply" on a filesystem without filemode support have learned
   to take a hint from what is in the index for the path, even when
   not working with the "--index" or "--cached" option, when checking
   the executable bit match what is required by the preimage in the
   patch.
   (merge 45b625142d cp/apply-core-filemode later to maint).

 * "git column" has been taught to reject negative padding value, as
   it would lead to nonsense behaviour including division by zero.
   (merge 76fb807faa kh/column-reject-negative-padding later to maint).

 * "git am --help" now tells readers what actions are available in
   "git am --whitespace=<action>", in addition to saying that the
   option is passed through to the underlying "git apply".
   (merge a171dac734 jc/am-whitespace-doc later to maint).

 * "git tag --column" failed to check the exit status of its "git
   column" invocation, which has been corrected.
   (merge 92e66478fc rj/tag-column-fix later to maint).

 * Credential helper based on libsecret (in contrib/) has been updated
   to handle an empty password correctly.
   (merge 8f1f2023b7 mh/libsecret-empty-password-fix later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge f0e578c69c rs/use-xstrncmpz later to maint).
   (merge 83e6eb7d7a ba/credential-test-clean-fix later to maint).
   (merge 64562d784d jb/doc-interactive-singlekey-do-not-need-perl later to maint).
