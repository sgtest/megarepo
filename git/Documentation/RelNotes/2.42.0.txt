Git v2.42 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features

 * "git pack-refs" learns "--include" and "--exclude" to tweak the ref
   hierarchy to be packed using pattern matching.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * "git diff-tree" has been taught to take advantage of the
   sparse-index feature.


Fixes since v2.41
-----------------

 * "git tag" learned to leave the "$GIT_DIR/TAG_EDITMSG" file when the
   command failed, so that the user can salvage what they typed.
   (merge 08c12ec1d0 kh/keep-tag-editmsg-upon-failure later to maint).

 * The "-s" (silent, squelch) option of the "diff" family of commands
   did not interact with other options that specify the output format
   well.  This has been cleaned up so that it will clear all the
   formatting options given before.
   (merge 9d484b92ed jc/diff-s-with-other-options later to maint).

 * Update documentation regarding Coccinelle patches.
   (merge 3bd0097cfc gc/doc-cocci-updates later to maint).

 * Some atoms that can be used in "--format=<format>" for "git ls-tree"
   were not supported by "git ls-files", even though they were relevant
   in the context of the latter.
   (merge 4d28c4f75f zh/ls-files-format-atoms later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge 51f9d2e563 sa/doc-ls-remote later to maint).
   (merge c6d26a9dda jk/format-patch-message-id-unleak later to maint).
