Git v2.43 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features

 * A message written in olden time prevented a branch from getting
   checked out saying it is already checked out elsewhere, but these
   days, we treat a branch that is being bisected or rebased just like
   a branch that is checked out and protect it.  Rephrase the message
   to say that the branch is in use.

 * Hourly and other schedule of "git maintenance" jobs are randomly
   distributed now.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * TBD.


Fixes since v2.42
-----------------

 * Overly long label names used in the sequencer machinery are now
   chopped to fit under filesystem limitation.
   (merge ac300bda10 mp/rebase-label-length-limit later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge fd3ba590d8 ws/git-push-doc-grammofix later to maint).
   (merge 5f33a843de ds/upload-pack-error-sequence-fix later to maint).
