Git v2.43 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features

 * A message written in olden time prevented a branch from getting
   checked out saying it is already checked out elsewhere, but these
   days, we treat a branch that is being bisected or rebased just like
   a branch that is checked out and protect it.  Rephrase the message
   to say that the branch is in use.

 * Hourly and other schedule of "git maintenance" jobs are randomly
   distributed now.

 * "git cmd -h" learned to signal which options can be negated by
   listing such options like "--[no-]opt".

 * The way authentication related data other than passwords (e.g.
   oath token and password expiration data) are stored in libsecret
   keyrings has been rethought.

 * Update two credential helpers to correctly match which credential
   to erase; they dropped not the ones with stale password.

 * Git GUI updates.

 * "git format-patch" learns a way to feed cover letter description,
   that (1) can be used on detached HEAD where there is no branch
   description available, and (2) also can override the branch
   description if there is one.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * "git check-attr" has been taught to work better with sparse-index.

 * It may be tempting to leave the help text NULL for a command line
   option that is either hidden or too obvious, but "git subcmd -h"
   and "git subcmd --help-all" would have segfaulted if done so.  Now
   the help text is optional.

 * Tests that are known to pass with LSan are now marked as such.
   (merge 5fafe8c95f tb/mark-more-tests-as-leak-free later to maint).

 * Flakey "git p4" tests, as well as "git svn" tests, are now skipped
   in the (rather expensive) sanitizer CI job.
   (merge 6ba913629f js/ci-san-skip-p4-and-svn-tests later to maint).

 * Tests with LSan from time to time seem to emit harmless message
   that makes our tests unnecessarily flakey; we work it around by
   filtering the uninteresting output.
   (merge 370ef7e40d jk/test-lsan-denoise-output later to maint).


Fixes since v2.42
-----------------

 * Overly long label names used in the sequencer machinery are now
   chopped to fit under filesystem limitation.
   (merge ac300bda10 mp/rebase-label-length-limit later to maint).

 * Scalar updates.
   (merge f9a547d3a7 ds/scalar-updates later to maint).

 * Tweak GitHub Actions CI so that pushing the same commit to multiple
   branch tips at the same time will not waste building and testing
   the same thing twice.
   (merge 99fe06cbfd jc/ci-skip-same-commit later to maint).

 * The commit-graph verification code that detects mixture of zero and
   non-zero generation numbers has been updated.
   (merge db6044d762 tb/commit-graph-verify-fix later to maint).

 * "git diff -w --exit-code" with various options did not work
   correctly, which is being addressed.
   (merge a64f8b2595 jc/diff-exit-code-with-w-fixes later to maint).

 * transfer.unpackLimit ought to be used as a fallback, but overrode
   fetch.unpackLimit and receive.unpackLimit instead.
   (merge f3d33f8cfe ts/unpacklimit-config-fix later to maint).

 * The use of API between two calls to require_clean_work_tree() from
   the sequencer code has been cleaned up for consistency.
   (merge a9b5955e07 ob/sequencer-empty-hint-fix later to maint).

 * "git diff --no-such-option" and other corner cases around the exit
   status of the "diff" command has been corrected.
   (merge 5cc6b2d70b jk/diff-result-code-cleanup later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge fd3ba590d8 ws/git-push-doc-grammofix later to maint).
   (merge 5f33a843de ds/upload-pack-error-sequence-fix later to maint).
   (merge beaa1d952b jk/function-pointer-mismatches-fix later to maint).
   (merge b46d806ea5 ob/t9001-indent-fix later to maint).
   (merge fdc9914c28 ja/worktree-orphan later to maint).
   (merge c2cbefc510 jc/mv-d-to-d-error-message-fix later to maint).
