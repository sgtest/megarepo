Git v2.43 Release Notes
=======================

Backward Compatibility Notes

 * The "--rfc" option of "git format-patch" used to be a valid way to
   override an earlier "--subject-prefix=<something>" on the command
   line and replace it with "[RFC PATCH]", but from this release, it
   merely prefixes the string "RFC " in front of the given subject
   prefix.  If you are negatively affected by this change, please use
   "--subject-prefix=PATCH --rfc" as a replacement.


UI, Workflows & Features

 * A message written in olden time prevented a branch from getting
   checked out saying it is already checked out elsewhere, but these
   days, we treat a branch that is being bisected or rebased just like
   a branch that is checked out and protect it.  Rephrase the message
   to say that the branch is in use.

 * Hourly and other schedule of "git maintenance" jobs are randomly
   distributed now.

 * "git cmd -h" learned to signal which options can be negated by
   listing such options like "--[no-]opt".

 * The way authentication related data other than passwords (e.g.
   oath token and password expiration data) are stored in libsecret
   keyrings has been rethought.

 * Update two credential helpers to correctly match which credential
   to erase; they dropped not the ones with stale password.

 * Git GUI updates.

 * "git format-patch" learns a way to feed cover letter description,
   that (1) can be used on detached HEAD where there is no branch
   description available, and (2) also can override the branch
   description if there is one.

 * Use of --max-pack-size to allow multiple packfiles to be created is
   now supported even when we are sending unreachable objects to cruft
   packs.

 * "git format-patch --rfc --subject-prefix=<foo>" used to ignore the
   "--subject-prefix" option and used "[RFC PATCH]"; now we will add
   "RFC" prefix to whatever subject prefix is specified.

 * "git log --format" has been taught the %(decorate) placeholder.

 * The default log message created by "git revert", when reverting a
   commit that records a revert, has been tweaked, to encourage people
   describe complex "revert of revert of revert" situation better in
   their own words.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * "git check-attr" has been taught to work better with sparse-index.

 * It may be tempting to leave the help text NULL for a command line
   option that is either hidden or too obvious, but "git subcmd -h"
   and "git subcmd --help-all" would have segfaulted if done so.  Now
   the help text is optional.

 * Tests that are known to pass with LSan are now marked as such.
   (merge 5fafe8c95f tb/mark-more-tests-as-leak-free later to maint).

 * Flakey "git p4" tests, as well as "git svn" tests, are now skipped
   in the (rather expensive) sanitizer CI job.
   (merge 6ba913629f js/ci-san-skip-p4-and-svn-tests later to maint).

 * Tests with LSan from time to time seem to emit harmless message
   that makes our tests unnecessarily flakey; we work it around by
   filtering the uninteresting output.
   (merge 370ef7e40d jk/test-lsan-denoise-output later to maint).

 * Unused parameters to functions are marked as such, and/or removed,
   in order to bring us closer to -Wunused-parameter clean.


Fixes since v2.42
-----------------

 * Overly long label names used in the sequencer machinery are now
   chopped to fit under filesystem limitation.
   (merge ac300bda10 mp/rebase-label-length-limit later to maint).

 * Scalar updates.
   (merge f9a547d3a7 ds/scalar-updates later to maint).

 * Tweak GitHub Actions CI so that pushing the same commit to multiple
   branch tips at the same time will not waste building and testing
   the same thing twice.
   (merge 99fe06cbfd jc/ci-skip-same-commit later to maint).

 * The commit-graph verification code that detects mixture of zero and
   non-zero generation numbers has been updated.
   (merge db6044d762 tb/commit-graph-verify-fix later to maint).

 * "git diff -w --exit-code" with various options did not work
   correctly, which is being addressed.
   (merge a64f8b2595 jc/diff-exit-code-with-w-fixes later to maint).

 * transfer.unpackLimit ought to be used as a fallback, but overrode
   fetch.unpackLimit and receive.unpackLimit instead.
   (merge f3d33f8cfe ts/unpacklimit-config-fix later to maint).

 * The use of API between two calls to require_clean_work_tree() from
   the sequencer code has been cleaned up for consistency.
   (merge a9b5955e07 ob/sequencer-empty-hint-fix later to maint).

 * "git diff --no-such-option" and other corner cases around the exit
   status of the "diff" command has been corrected.
   (merge 5cc6b2d70b jk/diff-result-code-cleanup later to maint).

 * "git for-each-ref --sort='contents:size'" sorts the refs according
   to size numerically, giving a ref that points at a blob twelve-byte
   (12) long before showing a blob hundred-byte (100) long.
   (merge 6d79cd8474 ks/ref-filter-sort-numerically later to maint).

 * We now limit depth of the tree objects and maximum length of
   pathnames recorded in tree objects.
   (merge 4d5693ba05 jk/tree-name-and-depth-limit later to maint).

 * Various fixes to the behaviour of "rebase -i" when the command got
   interrupted by conflicting changes.
   (merge 203573b024 pw/rebase-i-after-failure later to maint).

 * References from description of the `--patch` option in various
   manual pages have been simplified and improved.
   (merge 11422f23e3 so/diff-doc-for-patch-update later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge fd3ba590d8 ws/git-push-doc-grammofix later to maint).
   (merge 5f33a843de ds/upload-pack-error-sequence-fix later to maint).
