Git v2.43 Release Notes
=======================

UI, Workflows & Features

 * A message written in olden time prevented a branch from getting
   checked out saying it is already checked out elsewhere, but these
   days, we treat a branch that is being bisected or rebased just like
   a branch that is checked out and protect it.  Rephrase the message
   to say that the branch is in use.

 * Hourly and other schedule of "git maintenance" jobs are randomly
   distributed now.

 * "git cmd -h" learned to signal which options can be negated by
   listing such options like "--[no-]opt".

 * The way authentication related data other than passwords (e.g.
   oath token and password expiration data) are stored in libsecret
   keyrings has been rethought.

 * Update two credential helpers to correctly match which credential
   to erase; they dropped not the ones with stale password.

 * Git GUI updates.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * "git check-attr" has been taught to work better with sparse-index.



Fixes since v2.42
-----------------

 * Overly long label names used in the sequencer machinery are now
   chopped to fit under filesystem limitation.
   (merge ac300bda10 mp/rebase-label-length-limit later to maint).

 * Scalar updates.
   (merge f9a547d3a7 ds/scalar-updates later to maint).

 * Tweak GitHub Actions CI so that pushing the same commit to multiple
   branch tips at the same time will not waste building and testing
   the same thing twice.
   (merge 99fe06cbfd jc/ci-skip-same-commit later to maint).

 * The commit-graph verification code that detects mixture of zero and
   non-zero generation numbers has been updated.
   (merge db6044d762 tb/commit-graph-verify-fix later to maint).

 * "git diff -w --exit-code" with various options did not work
   correctly, which is being addressed.
   (merge a64f8b2595 jc/diff-exit-code-with-w-fixes later to maint).

 * transfer.unpackLimit ought to be used as a fallback, but overrode
   fetch.unpackLimit and receive.unpackLimit instead.
   (merge f3d33f8cfe ts/unpacklimit-config-fix later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge fd3ba590d8 ws/git-push-doc-grammofix later to maint).
   (merge 5f33a843de ds/upload-pack-error-sequence-fix later to maint).
