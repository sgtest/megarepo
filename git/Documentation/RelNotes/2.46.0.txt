Git v2.46 Release Notes
=======================

Backward Compatibility Notes

 (None at this moment)

UI, Workflows & Features

 * The "--rfc" option of "git format-patch" learned to take an
   optional string value to be used in place of "RFC" to tweak the
   "[PATCH]" on the subject header.
   (merge ce36894509 jc/format-patch-rfc-more later to maint).


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * Advertise "git contacts", a tool for newcomers to find people to
   ask review for their patches, a bit more in our developer
   documentation.

 * In addition to building the objects needed, try to link the objects
   that are used in fuzzer tests, to make sure at least they build
   without bitrot, in Linux CI runs.


Fixes since v2.45
-----------------

 * "git rebase --signoff" used to forget that it needs to add a
   sign-off to the resulting commit when told to continue after a
   conflict stops its operation.
   (merge a6c2654f83 pw/rebase-m-signoff-fix later to maint).

 * The procedure to build multi-pack-index got confused by the
   replace-refs mechanism, which has been corrected by disabling the
   latter.
   (merge 93e2ae1c95 xx/disable-replace-when-building-midx later to maint).

 * The "-k" and "--rfc" options of "format-patch" will now error out
   when used together, as one tells us not to add anything to the
   title of the commit, and the other one tells us to add "RFC" in
   addition to "PATCH".
   (merge cadcf58085 ds/format-patch-rfc-and-k later to maint).

 * "git stash -S" did not handle binary files correctly, which has
   been corrected.
   (merge 5fb7686409 aj/stash-staged-fix later to maint).

 * A scheduled "git maintenance" job is expected to work on all
   repositories it knows about, but it stopped at the first one that
   errored out.  Now it keeps going.
   (merge c75662bfc9 js/for-each-repo-keep-going later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
