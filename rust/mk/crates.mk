# Rust's standard distribution of crates and tools
#
# The crates outlined below are the standard distribution of libraries provided
# in a rust installation. These rules are meant to abstract over the
# dependencies (both native and rust) of crates and basically generate all the
# necessary makefile rules necessary to build everything.
#
# Here's an explanation of the variables below
#
#   TARGET_CRATES
#	This list of crates will be built for all targets, including
#	cross-compiled targets
#
#   HOST_CRATES
#	This list of crates will be compiled for only host targets. Note that
#	this set is explicitly *not* a subset of TARGET_CRATES, but rather it is
#	a disjoint set. Nothing in the TARGET_CRATES set can depend on crates in
#	the HOST_CRATES set, but the HOST_CRATES set can depend on target
#	crates.
#
#   TOOLS
#	A list of all tools which will be built as part of the compilation
#	process. It is currently assumed that most tools are built through
#	src/driver/driver.rs with a particular configuration (there's a
#	corresponding library providing the implementation)
#
#   DEPS_<crate>
#	These lists are the dependencies of the <crate> that is to be built.
#	Rust dependencies are listed bare (i.e. std, green) and native
#	dependencies have a "native:" prefix (i.e. native:hoedown). All deps
#	will be built before the crate itself is built.
#
#   TOOL_DEPS_<tool>/TOOL_SOURCE_<tool>
#	Similar to the DEPS variable, this is the library crate dependencies
#	list for tool as well as the source file for the specified tool
#
# You shouldn't need to modify much other than these variables. Crates are
# automatically generated for all stage/host/target combinations.
