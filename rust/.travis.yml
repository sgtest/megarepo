# The test suite is in general way too stressful for travis, especially in

# back to only build the stage1 compiler and run a subset of tests, but this
# didn't end up panning out very well.

# As a result, we're just using travis to run `make tidy` now. It'll help
# everyone find out about their trailing spaces early on!
