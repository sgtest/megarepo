"Rust tasks are not the same as traditional threads: rather, they are "
"considered _green threads_, lightweight units of execution that the Rust "
"runtime schedules cooperatively onto a small number of operating system "
"threads.  On a multi-core system Rust tasks will be scheduled in parallel by "
"default.  Because tasks are significantly cheaper to create than traditional "
"threads, Rust can create hundreds of thousands of concurrent tasks on a "
