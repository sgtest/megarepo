"Rust tasks are not the same as traditional threads: rather, they are "
"considered _green threads_, lightweight units of execution that the Rust "
"runtime schedules cooperatively onto a small number of operating system "
"threads.  On a multi-core system Rust tasks will be scheduled in parallel by "
"default.  Because tasks are significantly cheaper to create than traditional "
"threads, Rust can create hundreds of thousands of concurrent tasks on a "
"typical 32-bit system.  In general, all Rust code executes inside a task, "
"including the `main` function."

"In order to make efficient use of memory Rust tasks have dynamically sized "
"stacks.  A task begins its life with a small amount of stack space "
"(currently in the low thousands of bytes, depending on platform), and "
"acquires more stack as needed.  Unlike in languages such as C, a Rust task "
"cannot accidentally write to memory beyond the end of the stack, causing "
"crashes or worse."

"Tasks provide failure isolation and recovery. When a fatal error occurs in "
"Rust code as a result of an explicit call to `fail!()`, an assertion "
