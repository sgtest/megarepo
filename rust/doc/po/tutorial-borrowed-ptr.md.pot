"Borrowed pointers are one of the more flexible and powerful tools available "
"in Rust. A borrowed pointer can point anywhere: into the managed or exchange "
"heap, into the stack, and even into the interior of another data structure. "
"A borrowed pointer is as flexible as a C pointer or C++ reference. However, "
"unlike C and C++ compilers, the Rust compiler includes special static checks "
"that ensure that programs use borrowed pointers safely. Another advantage of "
"borrowed pointers is that they are invisible to the garbage collector, so "
"working with borrowed pointers helps reduce the overhead of automatic memory "
"management."

"Although borrowed pointers have rather elaborate theoretical underpinnings "
