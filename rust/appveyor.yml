  # 32/64-bit MinGW builds.
  #
  # The MinGW builds unfortunately have to both download a custom toolchain and
  # avoid the one installed by AppVeyor by default. Interestingly, though, for
  # different reasons!
  #
  # For 32-bit the installed gcc toolchain on AppVeyor uses the pthread
  # threading model. This is unfortunately not what we want, and if we compile
  # with it then there's lots of link errors in the standard library (undefined
  # references to pthread symbols).
  #
  # For 64-bit the installed gcc toolchain is currently 5.3.0 which
  # unfortunately segfaults on Windows with --enable-llvm-assertions (segfaults
  # in LLVM). See rust-lang/rust#28445 for more information, but to work around
  # this we go back in time to 4.9.2 specifically.
  #
  # Finally, note that the downloads below are all in the `rust-lang-ci` S3
  # bucket, but they cleraly didn't originate there! The downloads originally
  # came from the mingw-w64 SourceForge download site. Unfortunately
  # SourceForge is notoriously flaky, so we mirror it on our own infrastructure.
  #
  # And as a final point of note, the 32-bit MinGW build using the makefiles do
  # *not* use debug assertions and llvm assertions. This is because they take
  # too long on appveyor and this is tested by rustbuild below.
