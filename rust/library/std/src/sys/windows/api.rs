//! # Safe(r) wrappers around Windows API functions.
//!
//! This module contains fairly thin wrappers around Windows API functions,
//! aimed at centralising safety instead of having unsafe blocks spread
//! throughout higher level code. This makes it much easier to audit FFI safety.
//!
//! Not all functions can be made completely safe without more context but in
//! such cases we should still endeavour to reduce the caller's burden of safety
//! as much as possible.
//!
//! ## Guidelines for wrappers
//!
//! Items here should be named similarly to their raw Windows API name, except
//! that they follow Rust's case conventions. E.g. function names are
//! lower_snake_case. The idea here is that it should be easy for a Windows
//! C/C++ programmer to identify the underlying function that's being wrapped
//! while not looking too out of place in Rust code.
//!
//! Every use of an `unsafe` block must have a related SAFETY comment, even if
//! it's trivially safe (for example, see `get_last_error`). Public unsafe
//! functions must document what the caller has to do to call them safely.
//!
//! Avoid unchecked `as` casts. For integers, either assert that the integer
//! is in range or use `try_into` instead. For pointers, prefer to use
//! `ptr.cast::<Type>()` when possible.
//!
//! This module must only depend on core and not on std types as the eventual
//! hope is to have std depend on sys and not the other way around.
//! However, some amount of glue code may currently be necessary so such code
//! should go in sys/windows/mod.rs rather than here. See `IoResult` as an example.
