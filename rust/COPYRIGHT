* The auxiliary file src/etc/pkg/modpath.iss contains a
  library routine compiled, by Inno Setup, into the Windows
  installer binary. This file is licensed under the LGPL,
  but, in our legal interpretation, this does not affect the
  aggregate "collected work" license of the Rust
  distribution (MIT) nor any other components of it. We
  believe that the terms governing distribution of the
  binary Windows installer built from modpath.iss are
  therefore LGPL, but not the terms governing distribution
  of any of the files installed by such an installer (such
  as the Rust compiler or runtime libraries themselves).


* The libuv asynchronous I/O library. Code for this package
  is found in the src/libuv directory, within this
  distribution. This package is redistributed under the
  following terms, as noted in its source:

    OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR

    DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.


* Additional libraries included in libuv carry separate
  BSD-compatible licenses. See src/libuv/LICENSE for
  details.

* The src/rt/miniz.c file, carrying an implementation of
  RFC1950/RFC1951 DEFLATE, by Rich Geldreich
  <richgel99@gmail.com>. All uses of this file are
  permitted by the embedded "unlicense" notice

* Additional copyright may be retained by contributors other
  than Mozilla, the Rust Project Authors, or the parties
  enumerated in this file. Such copyright can be determined
  on a case-by-case basis by examining the author of each
  portion of a file in the revision-control commit records
  of the project, or by consulting representative comments
  claiming copyright ownership for a file.

  For example, the text:

      "Copyright (c) 2011 Google Inc."

  appears in some files, and these files thereby denote
  that their author and copyright-holder is Google Inc.

  In all such cases, the absence of explicit licensing text
  indicates that the contributor chose to license their work
  for distribution under identical terms to those Mozilla
  has chosen for the collective work, enumerated at the top
  of this file. The only difference is the retention of
  copyright itself, held by the contributor.
