    /// ### Explanation
    ///
    /// `Drop` bounds do not really accomplish anything. A type may have
    /// compiler-generated drop glue without implementing the `Drop` trait
    /// itself. The `Drop` trait also only has one method, `Drop::drop`, and
    /// that function is by fiat not callable in user code. So there is really
    /// no use case for using `Drop` in trait bounds.
    ///
    /// The most likely use case of a drop bound is to distinguish between
    /// types that have destructors and types that don't. Combined with
    /// specialization, a naive coder would write an implementation that
    /// assumed a type could be trivially dropped, then write a specialization
    /// for `T: Drop` that actually calls the destructor. Except that doing so
    /// is not correct; String, for example, doesn't actually implement Drop,
    /// but because String contains a Vec, assuming it can be trivially dropped
    /// will leak memory.

    /// ```
    ///
    /// {{produces}}
    ///
    /// ### Explanation
    ///
    /// A trait object bound of the form `dyn Drop` is most likely misleading
    /// and not what the programmer intended.
    ///
    /// `Drop` bounds do not actually indicate whether a type can be trivially
    /// dropped or not, because a composite type containing `Drop` types does
    /// not necessarily implement `Drop` itself. Na√Øvely, one might be tempted
    /// to write a deferred drop system, to pull cleaning up memory out of a
    /// latency-sensitive code path, using `dyn Drop` trait objects. However,
    /// this breaks down e.g. when `T` is `String`, which does not implement
    /// `Drop`, but should probably be accepted.
    ///
    /// To write a trait object bound that accepts anything, use a placeholder
    /// trait with a blanket implementation.
    ///

    /// trait Placeholder {}
    /// impl<T> Placeholder for T {}
