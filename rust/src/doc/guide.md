## Welcome!

Hey there! Welcome to the Rust guide. This is the place to be if you'd like to
learn how to program in Rust. Rust is a systems programming language with a
focus on "high-level, bare-metal programming": the lowest level control a
programming language can give you, but with zero-cost, higher level
abstractions, because people aren't computers. We really think Rust is
something special, and we hope you do too.

To show you how to get going with Rust, we're going to write the traditional
"Hello, World!" program. Next, we'll introduce you to a tool that's useful for
writing real-world Rust programs and libraries: "Cargo." Then, we'll show off
Rust's features by writing a little program together.

Sound good? Let's go!

## Installing Rust

The first step to using Rust is to install it! There are a number of ways to
install Rust, but the easiest is to use the the `rustup` script. If you're on
Linux or a Mac, All you need to do is this:

```{ignore}
$ curl -s http://www.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sudo sh
```

(If you're concerned about `curl | sudo sh`, please keep reading. Disclaimer
below.)

If you're on Windows, please [download this .exe and run
it](http://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-nightly-install.exe).

If you decide you don't want Rust anymore, we'll be a bit sad, but that's okay.
Not every programming language is great for everyone. Just pass an argument to
the script:

```{ignore}
$ curl -s http://www.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sudo sh -s -- --uninstall
```

If you used the Windows installer, just re-run the `.exe` and it will give you
an uninstall option.

You can re-run this script any time you want to update Rust. Which, at this
point, is often. Rust is still pre-1.0, and so people assume that you're using
a very recent Rust. 

This brings me to one other point: some people, and somewhat rightfully so, get
very upset when we tell you to `curl | sudo sh`. And they should be! Basically,
when you do this, you are trusting that the good people who maintain Rust
aren't going to hack your computer and do bad things. That's a good instinct!
If you're one of those people, please check out the documentation on [building
Rust from Source](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust#building-from-source), or
[the official binary downloads](http://www.rust-lang.org/install.html). And we
promise that this method will not be the way to install Rust forever: it's just
the easiest way to keep people updated while Rust is in its alpha state.

Oh, we should also mention the officially supported platforms:

* Windows (7, 8, Server 2008 R2), x86 only
* Linux (2.6.18 or later, various distributions), x86 and x86-64
* OSX 10.7 (Lion) or greater, x86 and x86-64

We extensively test Rust on these platforms, and a few others, too, like
Android. But these are the ones most likely to work, as they have the most
testing.

Finally, a comment about Windows. Rust considers Windows to be a first-class
platform upon release, but if we're honest, the Windows experience isn't as
integrated as the Linux/OS X experience is. We're working on it! If anything
does not work, it is a bug. Please let us know if that happens. Each and every
commit is tested against Windows just like any other platform.

If you've got Rust installed, you can open up a shell, and type this:

```{ignore}
$ rustc --version
```

You should see some output that looks something like this:

```{ignore}
rustc 0.11.0-pre (443a1cd 2014-06-08 14:56:52 -0700)
host: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

If you did, Rust has been installed successfully! Congrats!

If not, there are a number of places where you can get help. The easiest is
IRC, which you can access
[here](http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org&channel=%23rust). Click
that link, and you'll be chatting with other Rustaceans (a silly nickname we
call ourselves), and we can help you out. Other great resources include our
[mailing list](https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/rust-dev),
[subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/rust), and
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust).
