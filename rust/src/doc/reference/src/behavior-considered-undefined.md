## Behavior considered undefined

The following is a list of behavior which is forbidden in all Rust code,
including within `unsafe` blocks and `unsafe` functions. Type checking provides
the guarantee that these issues are never caused by safe code.

* Data races
* Dereferencing a null/dangling raw pointer
* Reads of [undef](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#undefined-values)
  (uninitialized) memory
* Breaking the [pointer aliasing
  rules](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#pointer-aliasing-rules)
  with raw pointers (a subset of the rules used by C)
* `&mut T` and `&T` follow LLVMâ€™s scoped [noalias] model, except if the `&T`
  contains an `UnsafeCell<U>`. Unsafe code must not violate these aliasing
  guarantees.
* Mutating non-mutable data (that is, data reached through a shared reference or
  data owned by a `let` binding), unless that data is contained within an `UnsafeCell<U>`.
* Invoking undefined behavior via compiler intrinsics:
  * Indexing outside of the bounds of an object with `std::ptr::offset`
    (`offset` intrinsic), with
    the exception of one byte past the end which is permitted.
  * Using `std::ptr::copy_nonoverlapping_memory` (`memcpy32`/`memcpy64`
    intrinsics) on overlapping buffers
* Invalid values in primitive types, even in private fields/locals:
  * Dangling/null references or boxes
  * A value other than `false` (0) or `true` (1) in a `bool`
  * A discriminant in an `enum` not included in the type definition
  * A value in a `char` which is a surrogate or above `char::MAX`
  * Non-UTF-8 byte sequences in a `str`
* Unwinding into Rust from foreign code or unwinding from Rust into foreign
  code. Rust's failure system is not compatible with exception handling in
  other languages. Unwinding must be caught and handled at FFI boundaries.
