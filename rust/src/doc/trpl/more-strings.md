% More Strings

Strings are an important concept to master in any programming language. If you
come from a managed language background, you may be surprised at the complexity
of string handling in a systems programming language. Efficient access and
allocation of memory for a dynamically sized structure involves a lot of
details. Luckily, Rust has lots of tools to help us here.

A **string** is a sequence of unicode scalar values encoded as a stream of
UTF-8 bytes. All strings are guaranteed to be validly-encoded UTF-8 sequences.
Additionally, strings are not null-terminated and can contain null bytes.

Rust has two main types of strings: `&str` and `String`.

# &str

The first kind is a `&str`. This is pronounced a 'string slice'.
String literals are of the type `&str`:

```
let string = "Hello there.";
```

Like any Rust reference, string slices have an associated lifetime. A string
literal is a `&'static str`.  A string slice can be written without an explicit
lifetime in many cases, such as in function arguments. In these cases the
lifetime will be inferred:

```
fn takes_slice(slice: &str) {
    println!("Got: {}", slice);
}
```

Like vector slices, string slices are simply a pointer plus a length. This
means that they're a 'view' into an already-allocated string, such as a
string literal or a `String`.

# String

A `String` is a heap-allocated string. This string is growable, and is also
guaranteed to be UTF-8.

```
let mut s = "Hello".to_string();
println!("{}", s);

s.push_str(", world.");
println!("{}", s);
```

You can coerce a `String` into a `&str` by dereferencing it:

```
fn takes_slice(slice: &str) {
    println!("Got: {}", slice);
}

fn main() {
    let s = "Hello".to_string();
    takes_slice(&*s);
}
```

You can also get a `&str` from a stack-allocated array of bytes:

```
use std::str;

let x: &[u8] = &[b'a', b'b'];
let stack_str: &str = str::from_utf8(x).unwrap();
```

# Best Practices

## `String` vs. `&str`

In general, you should prefer `String` when you need ownership, and `&str` when
you just need to borrow a string. This is very similar to using `Vec<T>` vs. `&[T]`,
and `T` vs `&T` in general.

This means starting off with this:

```{rust,ignore}
fn foo(s: &str) {
```

and only moving to this:

```{rust,ignore}
fn foo(s: String) {
```

If you have good reason. It's not polite to hold on to ownership you don't
need, and it can make your lifetimes more complex.

## Generic functions

To write a function that's generic over types of strings, use `&str`.

```
fn some_string_length(x: &str) -> uint {
    x.len()
}

fn main() {
    let s = "Hello, world";

    println!("{}", some_string_length(s));

    let s = "Hello, world".to_string();

    println!("{}", some_string_length(&s));
}
```

Both of these lines will print `12`.

## Indexing strings

You may be tempted to try to access a certain character of a `String`, like
this:

```{rust,ignore}
let s = "hello".to_string();

println!("{}", s[0]);
```

This does not compile. This is on purpose. In the world of UTF-8, direct
indexing is basically never what you want to do. The reason is that each
character can be a variable number of bytes. This means that you have to iterate
through the characters anyway, which is an O(n) operation.

There's 3 basic levels of unicode (and its encodings):

- code units, the underlying data type used to store everything
- code points/unicode scalar values (char)
- graphemes (visible characters)

Rust provides iterators for each of these situations:

- `.bytes()` will iterate over the underlying bytes
- `.chars()` will iterate over the code points
- `.graphemes()` will iterate over each grapheme

Usually, the `graphemes()` method on `&str` is what you want:

```
let s = "u͔n͈̰̎i̙̮͚̦c͚̉o̼̩̰͗d͔̆̓ͥé";

for l in s.graphemes(true) {
    println!("{}", l);
}
```

This prints:

```text
u͔
n͈̰̎
i̙̮͚̦
c͚̉
o̼̩̰͗
d͔̆̓ͥ
é
```

Note that `l` has the type `&str` here, since a single grapheme can consist of
multiple codepoints, so a `char` wouldn't be appropriate.

This will print out each visible character in turn, as you'd expect: first "u͔", then
"n͈̰̎", etc. If you wanted each individual codepoint of each grapheme, you can use `.chars()`:

```
let s = "u͔n͈̰̎i̙̮͚̦c͚̉o̼̩̰͗d͔̆̓ͥé";

for l in s.chars() {
    println!("{}", l);
}
```

This prints:

```text
u
͔
n
̎
͈
̰
i
̙
̮
͚
̦
c
̉
͚
o
͗
̼
̩
̰
d
̆
̓
ͥ
͔
e
́
```

You can see how some of them are combining characters, and therefore the output
looks a bit odd.

If you want the individual byte representation of each codepoint, you can use
`.bytes()`:

```
let s = "u͔n͈̰̎i̙̮͚̦c͚̉o̼̩̰͗d͔̆̓ͥé";

for l in s.bytes() {
    println!("{}", l);
}
```

This will print:

```text
117
205
148
110
204
142
205
136
204
176

100

134
205
131
205
165
205
148
101
204
129
```

Many more bytes than graphemes!
