% Advanced

In a similar fashion to "Intermediate," this section is full of individual,
deep-dive chapters, which stand alone and can be read in any order. These
chapters focus on the most complex features, as well as some things that
are only available in upcoming versions of Rust.

After reading "Advanced," you'll be a Rust expert!
