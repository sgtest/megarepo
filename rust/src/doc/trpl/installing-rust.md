% Installing Rust

The first step to using Rust is to install it! There are a number of ways to
install Rust, but the easiest is to use the `rustup` script. If we're on Linux
or a Mac, all we need to do is this:

> Note: we don't need to type in the `$`s, they just indicate the start of
> each command. We’ll see many tutorials and examples around the web that
> follow this convention: `$` for commands run as our regular user, and `#` for
> commands we should be running as an administrator.

```bash
$ curl -sf -L https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sh
```

If we're concerned about the [potential insecurity][insecurity] of using `curl |
sh`, please keep reading and see our disclaimer below. And feel free to use a
two-step version of the installation and examine our installation script:

```bash
$ curl -f -L https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh -O
$ sh rustup.sh
```

If you're on Windows, please download the appropriate [installer][install-page].

> Note: By default, the Windows installer won't add Rust to the %PATH% system
> variable. If this is the only version of Rust we are installing and we want to
> be able to run it from the command line, click on "Advanced" on the install
> dialog and on the "Product Features" page ensure "Add to PATH" is installed on
> the local hard drive.

## Uninstalling

If you decide you don't want Rust anymore, we'll be a bit sad, but that's okay.
Not every programming language is great for everyone. We'll just run the
uninstall script:

```bash
$ sudo /usr/local/lib/rustlib/uninstall.sh
```

If we used the Windows installer, we'll just re-run the `.msi` and it will give
us an uninstall option.

## That disclaimer we promised

Some people, and somewhat rightfully so, get very upset when we tell them to
`curl | sh`. Basically, when they do this, they are trusting that the good
people who maintain Rust aren't going to hack their computer and do bad things.
That's a good instinct! If you're one of those people, please check out the
documentation on [building Rust from Source][from-source], or [the official
binary downloads][install-page].

## Platform support

The Rust compiler runs on, and compiles to, a great number of platforms, though
not all platforms are equally supported. Rust's support levels are organized
into three tiers, each with a different set of guarantees.

Platforms are identified by their "target triple" which is the string to inform
the compiler what kind of output should be produced. The columns below indicate
whether the corresponding component works on the specified platform.

### Tier 1

Tier 1 platforms can be thought of as "guaranteed to build and work".
Specifically they will each satisfy the following requirements:

* Automated testing is set up to run tests for the platform.
* Landing changes to the `rust-lang/rust` repository's master branch is gated on
  tests passing.
* Official release artifacts are provided for the platform.
* Documentation for how to use and how to build the platform is available.

|-------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|----------------------------|
| `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`      |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  | 64-bit MSVC (Windows 7+)   |
| `i686-pc-windows-gnu`         |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  | 32-bit MinGW (Windows 7+)  |
| `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`       |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  | 64-bit MinGW (Windows 7+)  |
| `i686-apple-darwin`           |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  | 32-bit OSX (10.7+, Lion+)  |
| `x86_64-apple-darwin`         |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  | 64-bit OSX (10.7+, Lion+)  |
| `i686-unknown-linux-gnu`      |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  | 32-bit Linux (2.6.18+)     |
| `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`    |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  | 64-bit Linux (2.6.18+)     |

### Tier 2

Tier 2 platforms can be thought of as "guaranteed to build". Automated tests are
not run so it's not guaranteed to produce a working build, but platforms often
work to quite a good degree and patches are always welcome! Specifically, these
platforms are required to have each of the following:

* Automated building is set up, but may not be running tests.
* Landing changes to the `rust-lang/rust` repository's master branch is gated on
  platforms **building**. Note that this means for some platforms just the
  standard library is compiled, but for others the full bootstrap is run.
* Official release artifacts are provided for the platform.

|  Target                       | std |rustc|cargo| notes                      |
|-------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|----------------------------|
| `i686-pc-windows-msvc`        |  ✓  |  ✓  |  ✓  | 32-bit MSVC (Windows 7+)   |

### Tier 3

Tier 3 platforms are those which Rust has support for, but landing changes is
not gated on the platform either building or passing tests. Working builds for
these platforms may be spotty as their reliability is often defined in terms of
community contributions. Additionally, release artifacts and installers are not
provided, but there may be community infrastructure producing these in
unofficial locations.

tier 3 platforms that will ever be!

## After installation

If we've got Rust installed, we can open up a shell, and type this:

```bash
$ rustc --version
```

You should see the version number, commit hash, and commit date.

If you do, Rust has been installed successfully! Congrats!

If you don't and you're on Windows, check that Rust is in your %PATH% system
variable. If it isn't, run the installer again, select "Change" on the "Change,
repair, or remove installation" page and ensure "Add to PATH" is installed on
the local hard drive.

This installer also installs a copy of the documentation locally, so we can read
it offline. On UNIX systems, `/usr/local/share/doc/rust` is the location. On
Windows, it's in a `share/doc` directory, inside the directory to which Rust was
installed.

If not, there are a number of places where we can get help. The easiest is
[the #rust IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org][irc], which we can access through
[Mibbit][mibbit]. Click that link, and we'll be chatting with other Rustaceans
(a silly nickname we call ourselves) who can help us out. Other great resources
include [the user’s forum][users], and [Stack Overflow][stackoverflow].
