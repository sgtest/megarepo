% Conclusion

We covered a lot of ground here. When you've mastered everything in this Guide,
you will have a firm grasp of Rust development. There's a whole lot more
out there, though, we've just covered the surface. There's tons of topics that
you can dig deeper into, e.g. by reading the API documentation of the
[standard library](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/), by discovering solutions for
common problems on [Rust by Example](http://rustbyexample.com/), or by browsing
crates written by the community on [crates.io](https://crates.io/).

Happy hacking!
