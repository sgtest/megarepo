# `alloc_jemalloc`

The tracking issue for this feature is: [#33082]

[#33082]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/33082

See also [`alloc_system`](library-features/alloc-system.html).

------------------------

The compiler currently ships two default allocators: `alloc_system` and
`alloc_jemalloc` (some targets don't have jemalloc, however). These allocators
are normal Rust crates and contain an implementation of the routines to
allocate and deallocate memory. The standard library is not compiled assuming
either one, and the compiler will decide which allocator is in use at
compile-time depending on the type of output artifact being produced.

Binaries generated by the compiler will use `alloc_jemalloc` by default (where
available). In this situation the compiler "controls the world" in the sense of
it has power over the final link. Primarily this means that the allocator
decision can be left up the compiler.

Dynamic and static libraries, however, will use `alloc_system` by default. Here
Rust is typically a 'guest' in another application or another world where it
cannot authoritatively decide what allocator is in use. As a result it resorts
back to the standard APIs (e.g. `malloc` and `free`) for acquiring and releasing
memory.

# Switching Allocators

Although the compiler's default choices may work most of the time, it's often
necessary to tweak certain aspects. Overriding the compiler's decision about
which allocator is in use is done simply by linking to the desired allocator:

```rust,no_run
#![feature(alloc_system)]

extern crate alloc_system;

fn main() {
    let a = Box::new(4); // Allocates from the system allocator.
    println!("{}", a);
}
```

In this example the binary generated will not link to jemalloc by default but
instead use the system allocator. Conversely to generate a dynamic library which
uses jemalloc by default one would write:

```rust,ignore
#![feature(alloc_jemalloc)]
#![crate_type = "dylib"]

extern crate alloc_jemalloc;

pub fn foo() {
    let a = Box::new(4); // Allocates from jemalloc.
    println!("{}", a);
}
# fn main() {}
```
