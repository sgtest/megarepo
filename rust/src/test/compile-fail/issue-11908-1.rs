// aux-build:issue-11908-1.rs
// ignore-android this test is incompatible with the android test runner
// error-pattern: multiple dylib candidates for `collections` found

// This test ensures that if you have the same rlib or dylib at two locations
// in the same path that you don't hit an assertion in the compiler.
//
// Note that this relies on `libcollections` to be in the path somewhere else,
// and then our aux-built libraries will collide with libcollections (they have
// the same version listed)
