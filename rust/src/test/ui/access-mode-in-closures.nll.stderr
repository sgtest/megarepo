error[E0507]: cannot move out of borrowed content
  --> $DIR/access-mode-in-closures.rs:19:15

LL |         match *s { sty(v) => v } //~ ERROR cannot move out
   |               ^^       - move occurs because v has type `std::vec::Vec<isize>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |               |
   |               cannot move out of borrowed content
   |               help: consider removing this dereference operator: `s`

error: aborting due to previous error
