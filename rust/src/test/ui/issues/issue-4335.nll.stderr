error[E0373]: closure may outlive the current function, but it borrows `v`, which is owned by the current function

LL |     id(Box::new(|| *v))
   |                 ^^  - `v` is borrowed here

note: closure is returned here

LL |     id(Box::new(|| *v))
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
help: to force the closure to take ownership of `v` (and any other referenced variables), use the `move` keyword
   |
LL |     id(Box::new(move || *v))
   |                 ^^^^^^^
