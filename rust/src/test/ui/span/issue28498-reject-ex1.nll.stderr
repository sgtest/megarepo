   | here, drop of `foo` needs exclusive access to `foo.data`, because the type `Foo<Concrete<'_>>` implements the `Drop` trait
   | borrow later used here, when `foo` is dropped

   = note: consider using a `let` binding to create a longer lived value
   = note: values in a scope are dropped in the opposite order they are defined
