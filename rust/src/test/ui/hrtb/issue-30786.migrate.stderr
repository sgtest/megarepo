   = note: `Stream` would have to be implemented for the type `&'0 mut Map<Repeat, [closure@$DIR/issue-30786.rs:107:26: 107:35]>`, for any lifetime `'0`
   = note: but `Stream` is actually implemented for the type `&'1 mut Map<Repeat, [closure@$DIR/issue-30786.rs:107:26: 107:35]>`, for some specific lifetime `'1`
