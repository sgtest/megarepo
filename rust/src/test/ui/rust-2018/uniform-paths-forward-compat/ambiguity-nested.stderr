LL |       pub use std::io;
   |               ^^^ can refer to external crate `::std`
...
LL | /     mod std {
LL | |         pub struct io;
LL | |     }
   | |_____- may refer to `self::std` in the future
   |
   = help: write `::std` or `self::std` explicitly instead
   = note: in the future, `#![feature(uniform_paths)]` may become the default
