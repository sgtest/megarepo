17 |     let b = hello;
   |         - value moved here
18 |     let c = hello; //~ ERROR use of moved value: `hello` [E0382]
   |         ^ value used here after move
   |
   = note: move occurs because `hello` has type `[closure@$DIR/feature-gate-copy-closures.rs:13:17: 15:6 a:&i32]`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait

error: aborting due to previous error
