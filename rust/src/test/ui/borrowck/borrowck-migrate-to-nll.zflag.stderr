warning[E0507]: cannot move out of `foo` in pattern guard

LL |                 (|| { let bar = foo; bar.take() })();

   |                  |              move occurs because `foo` has type `&mut std::option::Option<&i32>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |                  |              move occurs due to use in closure
   |                  move out of `foo` occurs here

   = note: variables bound in patterns cannot be moved from until after the end of the pattern guard
