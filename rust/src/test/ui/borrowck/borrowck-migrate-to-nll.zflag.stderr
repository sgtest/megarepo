warning[E0502]: cannot borrow `*block.current` as immutable because it is also borrowed as mutable
  --> $DIR/borrowck-migrate-to-nll.rs:28:21

LL |     let x = &mut block;
   |             ---------- mutable borrow occurs here
LL |     let p: &'a u8 = &*block.current;
   |                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ immutable borrow occurs here
LL |     // (use `x` and `p` so enabling NLL doesn't assign overly short lifetimes)
LL |     drop(x);
   |          - mutable borrow later used here
