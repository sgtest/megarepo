error[E0596]: cannot borrow `foo.bar1` as mutable, as it is behind a `&` reference
  --> $DIR/borrowck-reborrow-from-mut.rs:98:17

LL | fn borrow_mut_from_imm(foo: &Foo) {
   |                             ---- help: consider changing this to be a mutable reference: `&mut Foo`
LL |     let _bar1 = &mut foo.bar1; //~ ERROR cannot borrow
   |                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `foo` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable
