  --> $DIR/issue-66958-non-copy-infered-type-arg.rs:11:20

LL |         Self::partial(self.0);
   |                       ------ value moved here
LL |         Self::full(self);
   |                    ^^^^ value used here after partial move
   |
   = note: move occurs because `self.0` has type `S`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
