   = help: the trait `FnMut<(char,)>` is not implemented for `u8`
   = help: the following other types implement trait `Pattern<'a>`:
             &'b String
             &'b [char; N]
             &'b [char]
             &'b str

             [char; N]
             char
             pattern::MultiCharEqPattern<C>
   = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `Pattern<'_>` for `u8`
