error[E0525]: expected a closure that implements the `Fn` trait, but this closure only implements `FnOnce`
  --> $DIR/closure-origin-tuple-diagnostics.rs:9:13

LL |     let c = || {
   |             ^^ this closure implements `FnOnce`, not `Fn`
LL |         let s = s.1;
   |                 --- closure is `FnOnce` because it moves the variable `s.1` out of its environment
LL |     };
LL |     expect_fn(c);
   |     --------- the requirement to implement `Fn` derives from here
