LL |     Variant1,
   |     ^^^^^^^^

note: the lint level is defined here

LL | #![deny(dead_code)]
   |         ^^^^^^^^^
note: `Enum` has a derived impl for the trait `Clone`, but this is intentionally ignored during dead code analysis
  --> $DIR/unused-variant.rs:3:10
   |
LL | #[derive(Clone)]
   |          ^^^^^
   = note: this error originates in the derive macro `Clone` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

error: aborting due to previous error
