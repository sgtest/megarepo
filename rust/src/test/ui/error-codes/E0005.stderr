error[E0005]: refutable pattern in local binding: `None` not covered
  --> $DIR/E0005.rs:3:9

   = note: `let` bindings require an "irrefutable pattern", like a `struct` or an `enum` with only one variant

help: you might want to use `if let` to ignore the variant that isn't matched

help: alternatively, on nightly, you might want to use `#![feature(let_else)]` to handle the variant that isn't matched
