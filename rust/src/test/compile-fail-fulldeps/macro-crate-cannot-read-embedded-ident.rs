// Issue #15750 and #15962 : this test is checking that the standard
// parser rejects embedded idents.  pnkfelix did not want to attempt
// to make a test file that itself used the embedded ident input form,
// since he worried that would be difficult to work with in many text
// editors, so instead he made a macro that expands into the embedded
// ident form.
