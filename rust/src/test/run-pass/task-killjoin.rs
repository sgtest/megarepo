// Create a task that is supervised by another task, join the supervised task
// from the supervising task, then fail the supervised task. The supervised
// task will kill the supervising task, waking it up. The supervising task no
// longer needs to be wakened when the supervised task exits.

    // Yield to make sure the supervisor joins before we fail. This is
    // currently not needed because the supervisor runs first, but I can
    // imagine that changing.
