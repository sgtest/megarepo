// Test cleanup of rvalue temporary that occurs while `~` construction
// is in progress. This scenario revealed a rather terrible bug.  The
// ingredients are:
//
// 1. Partial cleanup of `~` is in scope,
// 2. cleanup of return value from `get_bar()` is in scope,
// 3. do_it() fails.
//
// This led to a bug because `the top-most frame that was to be
// cleaned (which happens to be the partial cleanup of `~`) required
// multiple basic blocks, which led to us dropping part of the cleanup
// from the top-most frame.
//
// It's unclear how likely such a bug is to recur, but it seems like a
// scenario worth testing.
