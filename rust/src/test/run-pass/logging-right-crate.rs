// This is a test for issue #3046 to make sure that when we monomorphize a
// function from one crate to another the right top-level logging name is
// preserved.
//
// It used to be the case that if logging were turned on for this crate, all
// monomorphized functions from other crates had logging turned on (their
// logging module names were all incorrect). This test ensures that this no
// longer happens by enabling logging for *this* crate and then invoking a
// function in an external crate which will fail when logging is enabled.

extern crate logging_right_crate;

pub fn main() {
    // this function fails if logging is turned on
    logging_right_crate::foo::<int>();
}
