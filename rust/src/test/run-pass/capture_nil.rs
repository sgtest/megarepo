// This test has to be setup just so to trigger
// the condition which was causing us a crash.
// The situation is that we are capturing a
// () value by ref.  We generally feel free,
// however, to substitute NULL pointers and
// undefined values for values of () type, and
// so this caused a segfault when we copied into
// the closure.
//
// The fix is just to not emit any actual loads
// or stores for copies of () type (which is of
// course preferable, as the value itself is
// irrelevant).
