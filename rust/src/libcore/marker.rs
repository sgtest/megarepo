//! Primitive traits and marker types representing basic 'kinds' of types.
//!
//! Rust types can be classified in various useful ways according to
//! intrinsic properties of the type. These classifications, often called
//! 'kinds', are represented as traits.
//!
//! They cannot be implemented by user code, but are instead implemented
//! by the compiler automatically for the types to which they apply.
//!
//! Marker types are special types that are used with unsafe code to
//! inform the compiler of special constraints. Marker types should
//! only be needed when you are creating an abstraction that is
//! implemented using unsafe code. In that case, you may want to embed
//! some of the marker types below into your type.

/// By default, variable bindings have 'move semantics.' In other
/// words:
///
/// ```
/// #[derive(Debug)]
/// struct Foo;
///
/// let x = Foo;
///
/// let y = x;
///
/// // `x` has moved into `y`, and so cannot be used
///
/// // println!("{:?}", x); // error: use of moved value
/// ```
///
/// However, if a type implements `Copy`, it instead has 'copy semantics':
///
/// ```
/// // we can just derive a `Copy` implementation
/// #[derive(Debug, Copy)]
/// struct Foo;
///
/// let x = Foo;
///
/// let y = x;
///
/// // `y` is a copy of `x`
///
/// println!("{:?}", x); // A-OK!
/// ```
///
/// It's important to note that in these two examples, the only difference is if you are allowed to
/// access `x` after the assignment: a move is also a bitwise copy under the hood.
///
/// ## When can my type be `Copy`?
///
/// A type can implement `Copy` if all of its components implement `Copy`. For example, this
/// `struct` can be `Copy`:
///
/// ```
/// struct Point {
///    x: i32,
///    y: i32,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// A `struct` can be `Copy`, and `i32` is `Copy`, so therefore, `Point` is eligible to be `Copy`.
///
/// ```
/// # struct Point;
/// struct PointList {
///     points: Vec<Point>,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The `PointList` `struct` cannot implement `Copy`, because `Vec<T>` is not `Copy`. If we
/// attempt to derive a `Copy` implementation, we'll get an error.
///
/// ```text
/// error: the trait `Copy` may not be implemented for this type; field `points` does not implement
/// `Copy`
/// ```
///
/// ## How can I implement `Copy`?
///
/// There are two ways to implement `Copy` on your type:
///
/// ```
/// #[derive(Copy)]
/// struct MyStruct;
/// ```
///
/// and
///
/// ```
/// struct MyStruct;
/// impl Copy for MyStruct {}
/// ```
///
/// There is a small difference between the two: the `derive` strategy will also place a `Copy`
/// bound on type parameters, which isn't always desired.
///
/// ## When can my type _not_ be `Copy`?
///
/// Some types can't be copied safely. For example, copying `&mut T` would create an aliased
/// mutable reference, and copying `String` would result in two attempts to free the same buffer.
///
/// Generalizing the latter case, any type implementing `Drop` can't be `Copy`, because it's
/// managing some resource besides its own `size_of::<T>()` bytes.
///
/// ## When should my type be `Copy`?
///
/// Generally speaking, if your type _can_ implement `Copy`, it should. There's one important thing
/// to consider though: if you think your type may _not_ be able to implement `Copy` in the future,
/// then it might be prudent to not implement `Copy`. This is because removing `Copy` is a breaking
/// change: that second example would fail to compile if we made `Foo` non-`Copy`.

pub trait Copy : MarkerTrait {
    // Empty.
}

/// Types that can be safely shared between threads when aliased.
///
/// The precise definition is: a type `T` is `Sync` if `&T` is
/// thread-safe. In other words, there is no possibility of data races
/// when passing `&T` references between threads.
///
/// As one would expect, primitive types like `u8` and `f64` are all
/// `Sync`, and so are simple aggregate types containing them (like
/// tuples, structs and enums). More instances of basic `Sync` types
/// include "immutable" types like `&T` and those with simple
/// inherited mutability, such as `Box<T>`, `Vec<T>` and most other
/// collection types. (Generic parameters need to be `Sync` for their
/// container to be `Sync`.)
///
/// A somewhat surprising consequence of the definition is `&mut T` is
/// `Sync` (if `T` is `Sync`) even though it seems that it might
/// provide unsynchronised mutation. The trick is a mutable reference
/// stored in an aliasable reference (that is, `& &mut T`) becomes
/// read-only, as if it were a `& &T`, hence there is no risk of a data
/// race.
///
/// Types that are not `Sync` are those that have "interior
/// mutability" in a non-thread-safe way, such as `Cell` and `RefCell`
/// in `std::cell`. These types allow for mutation of their contents
/// even when in an immutable, aliasable slot, e.g. the contents of
/// `&Cell<T>` can be `.set`, and do not ensure data races are
/// impossible, hence they cannot be `Sync`. A higher level example
/// of a non-`Sync` type is the reference counted pointer
/// `std::rc::Rc`, because any reference `&Rc<T>` can clone a new
/// reference, which modifies the reference counts in a non-atomic
/// way.
///
/// For cases when one does need thread-safe interior mutability,
/// types like the atomics in `std::sync` and `Mutex` & `RWLock` in
/// the `sync` crate do ensure that any mutation cannot cause data
/// races.  Hence these types are `Sync`.
///
/// Any types with interior mutability must also use the `std::cell::UnsafeCell` wrapper around the
/// value(s) which can be mutated when behind a `&` reference; not doing this is undefined
/// behaviour (for example, `transmute`-ing from `&T` to `&mut T` is illegal).

/// methods that compiler should "pretend" exists. This most commonly
/// occurs for traits with no methods: in that particular case, you
/// can extend `MarkerTrait`, which is equivalent to
/// `PhantomFn<Self>`.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// As an example, consider a trait with no methods like `Even`, meant
/// to represent types that are "even":
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// trait Even { }
/// ```
///
/// In this case, because the implicit parameter `Self` is unused, the
/// compiler will issue an error. The only purpose of this trait is to
/// categorize types (and hence instances of those types) as "even" or
/// not, so if we *were* going to have a method, it might look like:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// trait Even {
///     fn is_even(self) -> bool { true }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Therefore, we can model a method like this as follows:
///
/// ```
/// use std::marker::PhantomFn;
/// trait Even : PhantomFn<Self> { }
/// ```
///
/// Another equivalent, but clearer, option would be to use
/// `MarkerTrait`:
///
/// ```
/// use std::marker::MarkerTrait;
/// trait Even : MarkerTrait { }
/// ```
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `A` represents the type of the method's argument. You can use a
///   tuple to represent "multiple" arguments. Any types appearing here
///   will be considered "contravariant".
/// - `R`, if supplied, represents the method's return type. This defaults
///   to `()` as it is rarely needed.
