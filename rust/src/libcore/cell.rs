//! Shareable mutable containers.
//!
//! Values of the `Cell` and `RefCell` types may be mutated through
//! shared references (i.e. the common `&T` type), whereas most Rust
//! types can only be mutated through unique (`&mut T`) references. We
//! say that `Cell` and `RefCell` provide *interior mutability*, in
//! contrast with typical Rust types that exhibit *inherited
//! mutability*.
//!
//! Cell types come in two flavors: `Cell` and `RefCell`. `Cell`
//! provides `get` and `set` methods that change the
//! interior value with a single method call. `Cell` though is only
//! compatible with types that implement `Copy`. For other types,
//! one must use the `RefCell` type, acquiring a write lock before
//! mutating.
//!
//! `RefCell` uses Rust's lifetimes to implement *dynamic borrowing*,
//! a process whereby one can claim temporary, exclusive, mutable
//! access to the inner value. Borrows for `RefCell`s are tracked *at
//! runtime*, unlike Rust's native reference types which are entirely
//! tracked statically, at compile time. Because `RefCell` borrows are
//! dynamic it is possible to attempt to borrow a value that is
//! already mutably borrowed; when this happens it results in task
//! failure.
//!
//! # When to choose interior mutability
//!
//! The more common inherited mutability, where one must have unique
//! access to mutate a value, is one of the key language elements that
//! enables Rust to reason strongly about pointer aliasing, statically
//! preventing crash bugs. Because of that, inherited mutability is
//! preferred, and interior mutability is something of a last
//! resort. Since cell types enable mutation where it would otherwise
//! be disallowed though, there are occasions when interior
//! mutability might be appropriate, or even *must* be used, e.g.
//!
//! * Introducing inherited mutability roots to shared types.
//! * Implementation details of logically-immutable methods.
//! * Mutating implementations of `clone`.
//!
//! ## Introducing inherited mutability roots to shared types
//!
//! Shared smart pointer types, including `Rc` and `Arc`, provide
//! containers that can be cloned and shared between multiple parties.
//! Because the contained values may be multiply-aliased, they can
//! only be borrowed as shared references, not mutable references.
//! Without cells it would be impossible to mutate data inside of
//! shared boxes at all!
//!
//! It's very common then to put a `RefCell` inside shared pointer
//! types to reintroduce mutability:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::collections::HashMap;
//! use std::cell::RefCell;
//! use std::rc::Rc;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let shared_map: Rc<RefCell<_>> = Rc::new(RefCell::new(HashMap::new()));
//!     shared_map.borrow_mut().insert("africa", 92388i);
//!     shared_map.borrow_mut().insert("kyoto", 11837i);
//!     shared_map.borrow_mut().insert("piccadilly", 11826i);
//!     shared_map.borrow_mut().insert("marbles", 38i);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Implementation details of logically-immutable methods
//!
//! Occasionally it may be desirable not to expose in an API that
//! there is mutation happening "under the hood". This may be because
//! logically the operation is immutable, but e.g. caching forces the
//! implementation to perform mutation; or because you must employ
//! mutation to implement a trait method that was originally defined
//! to take `&self`.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::cell::RefCell;
//!
//! struct Graph {
//!     edges: Vec<(uint, uint)>,
//!     span_tree_cache: RefCell<Option<Vec<(uint, uint)>>>
//! }
//!
//! impl Graph {
//!     fn minimum_spanning_tree(&self) -> Vec<(uint, uint)> {
//!         // Create a new scope to contain the lifetime of the
//!         // dynamic borrow
//!         {
//!             // Take a reference to the inside of cache cell
//!             let mut cache = self.span_tree_cache.borrow_mut();
//!             if cache.is_some() {
//!                 return cache.as_ref().unwrap().clone();
//!             }
//!
//!             let span_tree = self.calc_span_tree();
//!             *cache = Some(span_tree);
//!         }
//!
//!         // Recursive call to return the just-cached value.
//!         // Note that if we had not let the previous borrow
//!         // of the cache fall out of scope then the subsequent
//!         // recursive borrow would cause a dynamic task failure.
//!         // This is the major hazard of using `RefCell`.
//!         self.minimum_spanning_tree()
//!     }
//! #   fn calc_span_tree(&self) -> Vec<(uint, uint)> { vec![] }
//! }
//! # fn main() { }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Mutating implementations of `clone`
//!
//! This is simply a special - but common - case of the previous:
//! hiding mutability for operations that appear to be immutable.
//! The `clone` method is expected to not change the source value, and
//! is declared to take `&self`, not `&mut self`. Therefore any
//! mutation that happens in the `clone` method must use cell
//! types. For example, `Rc` maintains its reference counts within a
//! `Cell`.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::cell::Cell;
//!
//! struct Rc<T> {
//!     ptr: *mut RcBox<T>
//! }
//!
//! struct RcBox<T> {
//!     value: T,
//!     refcount: Cell<uint>
//! }
//!
//! impl<T> Clone for Rc<T> {
//!     fn clone(&self) -> Rc<T> {
//!         unsafe {
//!             (*self.ptr).refcount.set((*self.ptr).refcount.get() + 1);
//!             Rc { ptr: self.ptr }
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
