//! The Finally trait provides a method, `finally` on
//! stack closures that emulates Java-style try/finally blocks.
//!
//! Using the `finally` method is sometimes convenient, but the type rules
//! prohibit any shared, mutable state between the "try" case and the
//! "finally" case. For advanced cases, the `try_finally` function can
//! also be used. See that function for more details.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! # #![feature(unboxed_closures)]
//!
//! use std::finally::Finally;
//!
//! (|| {
//!     // ...
//! }).finally(|| {
//!     // this code is always run
//! })
//! ```

/// The most general form of the `finally` functions. The function
/// `try_fn` will be invoked first; whether or not it panics, the
/// function `finally_fn` will be invoked next. The two parameters
/// `mutate` and `drop` are used to thread state through the two
/// closures. `mutate` is used for any shared, mutable state that both
/// closures require access to; `drop` is used for any state that the
/// `try_fn` requires ownership of.
///
/// **WARNING:** While shared, mutable state between the try and finally
/// function is often necessary, one must be very careful; the `try`
/// function could have panicked at any point, so the values of the shared
/// state may be inconsistent.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use std::finally::try_finally;
///
/// struct State<'a> { buffer: &'a mut [u8], len: usize }
/// # let mut buf = [];
/// let mut state = State { buffer: &mut buf, len: 0 };
/// try_finally(
///     &mut state, (),
///     |state, ()| {
///         // use state.buffer, state.len
///     },
///     |state| {
///         // use state.buffer, state.len to cleanup
///     })
