/// Both `PLACE <- EXPR` and `box EXPR` desugar into expressions
/// that allocate an intermediate "place" that holds uninitialized
/// state.  The desugaring evaluates EXPR, and writes the result at
/// the address returned by the `pointer` method of this trait.
///
/// A `Place` can be thought of as a special representation for a
/// hypothetical `&uninit` reference (which Rust cannot currently
/// express directly). That is, it represents a pointer to
/// uninitialized storage.
///
/// The client is responsible for two steps: First, initializing the
/// payload (it can access its address via `pointer`). Second,
/// converting the agent to an instance of the owning pointer, via the
/// appropriate `finalize` method (see the `InPlace`.
///
/// If evaluating EXPR fails, then it is up to the destructor for the
/// implementation of Place to clean up any intermediate state
/// (e.g. deallocate box storage, pop a stack, etc).
