//! A module for working with borrowed data.
//!
//! # The `BorrowFrom` traits
//!
//! In general, there may be several ways to "borrow" a piece of data.  The
//! typical ways of borrowing a type `T` are `&T` (a shared borrow) and `&mut T`
//! (a mutable borrow). But types like `Vec<T>` provide additional kinds of
//! borrows: the borrowed slices `&[T]` and `&mut [T]`.
//!
//! When writing generic code, it is often desirable to abstract over all ways
//! of borrowing data from a given type. That is the role of the `BorrowFrom`
//! trait: if `T: BorrowFrom<U>`, then `&T` can be borrowed from `&U`.  A given
//! type can be borrowed as multiple different types. In particular, `Vec<T>:
//! BorrowFrom<Vec<T>>` and `[T]: BorrowFrom<Vec<T>>`.
//!
//! # The `ToOwned` trait
//!
//! Some types make it possible to go from borrowed to owned, usually by
//! implementing the `Clone` trait. But `Clone` works only for going from `&T`
//! to `T`. The `ToOwned` trait generalizes `Clone` to construct owned data
//! from any borrow of a given type.
//!
//! # The `Cow` (clone-on-write) type
//!
//! The type `Cow` is a smart pointer providing clone-on-write functionality: it
//! can enclose and provide immutable access to borrowed data, and clone the
//! data lazily when mutation or ownership is required. The type is designed to
//! work with general borrowed data via the `BorrowFrom` trait.
//!
//! `Cow` implements both `Deref`, which means that you can call
//! non-mutating methods directly on the data it encloses. If mutation
//! is desired, `to_mut` will obtain a mutable references to an owned
//! value, cloning if necessary.
