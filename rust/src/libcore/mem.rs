/**
 * Replace the value at a mutable location with a new one, returning the old
 * value, without deinitialising or copying either one.
 *
 * This is primarily used for transferring and swapping ownership of a value
 * in a mutable location. For example, this function allows consumption of
 * one field of a struct by replacing it with another value. The normal approach
 * doesn't always work:
 *
 * ```rust,ignore
 * struct Buffer<T> { buf: Vec<T> }
 *
 * impl<T> Buffer<T> {
 *     fn get_and_reset(&mut self) -> Vec<T> {
 *         // error: cannot move out of dereference of `&mut`-pointer
 *         let buf = self.buf;
 *         self.buf = Vec::new();
 *         buf
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note that `T` does not necessarily implement `Clone`, so it can't even
 * clone and reset `self.buf`. But `replace` can be used to disassociate
 * the original value of `self.buf` from `self`, allowing it to be returned:
 *
 * ```rust
 * # struct Buffer<T> { buf: Vec<T> }
 * impl<T> Buffer<T> {
 *     fn get_and_reset(&mut self) -> Vec<T> {
 *         use std::mem::replace;
 *         replace(&mut self.buf, Vec::new())
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
