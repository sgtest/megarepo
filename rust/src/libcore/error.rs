//! Traits for working with Errors.
//!
//! # The `Error` trait
//!
//! `Error` is a trait representing the basic expectations for error values,
//! i.e. values of type `E` in `Result<T, E>`. At a minimum, errors must provide
//! a description, but they may optionally provide additional detail (via
//! `Display`) and cause chain information:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::fmt::Display;
//!
//! trait Error: Display {
//!     fn description(&self) -> &str;
//!
//!     fn cause(&self) -> Option<&Error> { None }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The `cause` method is generally used when errors cross "abstraction
//! boundaries", i.e.  when a one module must report an error that is "caused"
//! by an error from a lower-level module. This setup makes it possible for the
//! high-level module to provide its own errors that do not commit to any
//! particular implementation, but also reveal some of its implementation for
//! debugging via `cause` chains.

    /// A short description of the error.
    ///
    /// The description should not contain newlines or sentence-ending
    /// punctuation, to facilitate embedding in larger user-facing
    /// strings.
    #[stable(feature = "rust1", since = "1.0.0")]
    fn description(&self) -> &str;

    /// The lower-level cause of this error, if any.
    #[stable(feature = "rust1", since = "1.0.0")]
    fn cause(&self) -> Option<&Error> { None }
