//! Homing I/O implementation
//!
//! In libuv, whenever a handle is created on an I/O loop it is illegal to use
//! that handle outside of that I/O loop. We use libuv I/O with our green
//! scheduler, and each green scheduler corresponds to a different I/O loop on a
//! different OS thread. Green tasks are also free to roam among schedulers,
//! which implies that it is possible to create an I/O handle on one event loop
//! and then attempt to use it on another.
//!
//! In order to solve this problem, this module implements the notion of a
//! "homing operation" which will transplant a task from its currently running
//! scheduler back onto the original I/O loop. This is accomplished entirely at
//! the librustuv layer with very little cooperation from the scheduler (which
//! we don't even know exists technically).
//!
//! These homing operations are completed by first realizing that we're on the
//! wrong I/O loop, then descheduling ourselves, sending ourselves to the
//! correct I/O loop, and then waking up the I/O loop in order to process its
//! local queue of tasks which need to run.
//!
//! This enqueueing is done with a concurrent queue from libstd, and the
//! signalling is achieved with an async handle.
