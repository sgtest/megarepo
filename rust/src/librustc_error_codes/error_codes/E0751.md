There are both a positive and negative trait implementation for the same type.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0748
trait MyTrait {}
impl MyTrait for i32 { }
impl !MyTrait for i32 { }
```

Negative implementations are a promise that the trait will never be
implemented for the given types.
