The only functions that can be called in static or constant expressions are
`const` functions, and struct/enum constructors. `const` functions are only
available on a nightly compiler. Rust currently does not support more general
compile-time function execution.

```
const FOO: Option<u8> = Some(1); // enum constructor
struct Bar {x: u8}
const BAR: Bar = Bar {x: 1}; // struct constructor
```

See [RFC 911] for more details on the design of `const fn`s.
