An invalid input operand constraint was passed to the `asm` macro (third line).

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0663
asm!("xor %eax, %eax"
     :
     : "+test"("a")
    );
```

Considering that this would be a long explanation, we instead recommend you
take a look at the [`asm`] chapter of the Unstable book:
