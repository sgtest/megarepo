Rust only supports variadic parameters for interoperability with C code in its
FFI. As such, variadic parameters can only be used with functions which are
using the C ABI. Examples of erroneous code:

```compile_fail
#![feature(unboxed_closures)]

extern "rust-call" { fn foo(x: u8, ...); }

// or

fn foo(x: u8, ...) {}
```

To fix such code, put them in an extern "C" block:

```
extern "C" {
    fn foo (x: u8, ...);
}
```
