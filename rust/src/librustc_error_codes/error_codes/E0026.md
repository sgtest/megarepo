This error indicates that a struct pattern attempted to extract a non-existent
field from a struct. Struct fields are identified by the name used before the
colon `:` so struct patterns should resemble the declaration of the struct type
being matched.

```
// Correct matching.
struct Thing {
    x: u32,
    y: u32
}

let thing = Thing { x: 1, y: 2 };

match thing {
    Thing { x: xfield, y: yfield } => {}
}
```

If you are using shorthand field patterns but want to refer to the struct field
by a different name, you should rename it explicitly.

Change this:

```compile_fail,E0026
struct Thing {
    x: u32,
    y: u32
}

let thing = Thing { x: 0, y: 0 };

match thing {
    Thing { x, z } => {}
}
```

To this:

```
struct Thing {
    x: u32,
    y: u32
}

let thing = Thing { x: 0, y: 0 };

match thing {
    Thing { x, y: z } => {}
}
```
