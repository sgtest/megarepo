This error indicates that an attempted implementation of a trait method
has the wrong number of type or const parameters.

For example, the trait below has a method `foo` with a type parameter `T`,
but the implementation of `foo` for the type `Bar` is missing this parameter:

```compile_fail,E0049
trait Foo {
    fn foo<T: Default>(x: T) -> Self;
}

struct Bar;

// error: method `foo` has 0 type parameters but its trait declaration has 1
// type parameter
impl Foo for Bar {
    fn foo(x: bool) -> Self { Bar }
}
```
