//! The "green scheduling" library
//!
//! This library provides M:N threading for rust programs. Internally this has
//! the implementation of a green scheduler along with context switching and a
//! stack-allocation strategy. This can be optionally linked in to rust
//! programs in order to provide M:N functionality inside of 1:1 programs.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! An M:N scheduling library implies that there are N OS thread upon which M
//! "green threads" are multiplexed. In other words, a set of green threads are
//! all run inside a pool of OS threads.
//!
//! With this design, you can achieve _concurrency_ by spawning many green
//! threads, and you can achieve _parallelism_ by running the green threads
//! simultaneously on multiple OS threads. Each OS thread is a candidate for
//! being scheduled on a different core (the source of parallelism), and then
//! all of the green threads cooperatively schedule amongst one another (the
//! source of concurrency).
//!
//! ## Schedulers
//!
//! In order to coordinate among green threads, each OS thread is primarily
//! running something which we call a Scheduler. Whenever a reference to a
//! Scheduler is made, it is synonymous to referencing one OS thread. Each
//! scheduler is bound to one and exactly one OS thread, and the thread that it
//! is bound to never changes.
//!
//! Each scheduler is connected to a pool of other schedulers (a `SchedPool`)
//! which is the thread pool term from above. A pool of schedulers all share the
//! work that they create. Furthermore, whenever a green thread is created (also
//! synonymously referred to as a green task), it is associated with a
//! `SchedPool` forevermore. A green thread cannot leave its scheduler pool.
//!
//! Schedulers can have at most one green thread running on them at a time. When
//! a scheduler is asleep on its event loop, there are no green tasks running on
//! the OS thread or the scheduler. The term "context switch" is used for when
//! the running green thread is swapped out, but this simply changes the one
//! green thread which is running on the scheduler.
//!
//! ## Green Threads
//!
//! A green thread can largely be summarized by a stack and a register context.
//! Whenever a green thread is spawned, it allocates a stack, and then prepares
//! a register context for execution. The green task may be executed across
//! multiple OS threads, but it will always use the same stack and it will carry
//! its register context across OS threads.
//!
//! Each green thread is cooperatively scheduled with other green threads.
//! Primarily, this means that there is no pre-emption of a green thread. The
//! major consequence of this design is that a green thread stuck in an infinite
//! loop will prevent all other green threads from running on that particular
//! scheduler.
//!
//! Scheduling events for green threads occur on communication and I/O
//! boundaries. For example, if a green task blocks waiting for a message on a
//! channel some other green thread can now run on the scheduler. This also has
//! the consequence that until a green thread performs any form of scheduling
//! event, it will be running on the same OS thread (unconditionally).
//!
//! ## Work Stealing
//!
//! With a pool of schedulers, a new green task has a number of options when
//! deciding where to run initially. The current implementation uses a concept
//! called work stealing in order to spread out work among schedulers.
//!
//! In a work-stealing model, each scheduler maintains a local queue of tasks to
//! run, and this queue is stolen from by other schedulers. Implementation-wise,
//! work stealing has some hairy parts, but from a user-perspective, work
//! stealing simply implies what with M green threads and N schedulers where
//! M > N it is very likely that all schedulers will be busy executing work.
//!
//! # Considerations when using libgreen
//!
//! An M:N runtime has both pros and cons, and there is no one answer as to
//! whether M:N or 1:1 is appropriate to use. As always, there are many
//! advantages and disadvantages between the two. Regardless of the workload,
//! however, there are some aspects of using green thread which you should be
//! aware of:
//!
//! * The largest concern when using libgreen is interoperating with native
//!   code. Care should be taken when calling native code that will block the OS
//!   thread as it will prevent further green tasks from being scheduled on the
//!   OS thread.
//!
//! * Native code using thread-local-storage should be approached
//!   with care. Green threads may migrate among OS threads at any time, so
//!   native libraries using thread-local state may not always work.
//!
//! * Native synchronization primitives (e.g. pthread mutexes) will also not
//!   work for green threads. The reason for this is because native primitives
//!   often operate on a _os thread_ granularity whereas green threads are
//!   operating on a more granular unit of work.
//!
//! * A green threading runtime is not fork-safe. If the process forks(), it
//!   cannot expect to make reasonable progress by continuing to use green
//!   threads.
//!
//! Note that these concerns do not mean that operating with native code is a
//! lost cause. These are simply just concerns which should be considered when
//! invoking native code.
//!
//! # Starting with libgreen
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate green;
//!
//! #[start]
//! fn start(argc: int, argv: **u8) -> int { green::start(argc, argv, main) }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // this code is running in a pool of schedulers
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Using a scheduler pool
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::task::TaskOpts;
//! use green::{SchedPool, PoolConfig};
//! use green::sched::{PinnedTask, TaskFromFriend};
//!
//! let config = PoolConfig::new();
//! let mut pool = SchedPool::new(config);
//!
//! // Spawn tasks into the pool of schedulers
//! pool.spawn(TaskOpts::new(), proc() {
//!     // this code is running inside the pool of schedulers
//!
//!     spawn(proc() {
//!         // this code is also running inside the same scheduler pool
//!     });
//! });
//!
//! // Dynamically add a new scheduler to the scheduler pool. This adds another
//! // OS thread that green threads can be multiplexed on to.
//! let mut handle = pool.spawn_sched();
//!
//! // Pin a task to the spawned scheduler
//! let task = pool.task(TaskOpts::new(), proc() { /* ... */ });
//! handle.send(PinnedTask(task));
//!
//! // Schedule a task on this new scheduler
//! let task = pool.task(TaskOpts::new(), proc() { /* ... */ });
//! handle.send(TaskFromFriend(task));
//!
//! // Handles keep schedulers alive, so be sure to drop all handles before
//! // destroying the sched pool
//! drop(handle);
//!
//! // Required to shut down this scheduler pool.
//! // The task will fail if `shutdown` is not called.
//! pool.shutdown();
//! ```
