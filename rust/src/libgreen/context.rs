// Register contexts used in various architectures
//
// These structures all represent a context of one task throughout its
// execution. Each struct is a representation of the architecture's register
// set. When swapping between tasks, these register sets are used to save off
// the current registers into one struct, and load them all from another.
//
// Note that this is only used for context switching, which means that some of
// the registers may go unused. For example, for architectures with
// callee/caller saved registers, the context will only reflect the callee-saved
// registers. This is because the caller saved registers are already stored
// elsewhere on the stack (if it was necessary anyway).
//
// Additionally, there may be fields on various architectures which are unused
// entirely because they only reflect what is theoretically possible for a
// "complete register set" to show, but user-space cannot alter these registers.
// An example of this would be the segment selectors for x86.
//
// These structures/functions are roughly in-sync with the source files inside
// of src/rt/arch/$arch. The only currently used function from those folders is
// the `rust_swap_registers` function, but that's only because for now segmented
// stacks are disabled.
