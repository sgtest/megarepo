//! Named pipes implementation for windows
//!
//! If are unfortunate enough to be reading this code, I would like to first
//! apologize. This was my first encounter with windows named pipes, and it
//! didn't exactly turn out very cleanly. If you, too, are new to named pipes,
//! read on as I'll try to explain some fun things that I ran into.
//!
//! # Unix pipes vs Named pipes
//!
//! As with everything else, named pipes on windows are pretty different from
//! unix pipes on unix. On unix, you use one "server pipe" to accept new client
//! pipes. So long as this server pipe is active, new children pipes can
//! connect. On windows, you instead have a number of "server pipes", and each
//! of these server pipes can throughout their lifetime be attached to a client
//! or not. Once attached to a client, a server pipe may then disconnect at a
//! later date.
//!
//! # Accepting clients
//!
//! As with most other I/O interfaces, our Listener/Acceptor/Stream interfaces
//! are built around the unix flavors. This means that we have one "server
//! pipe" to which many clients can connect. In order to make this compatible
//! with the windows model, each connected client consumes ownership of a server
//! pipe, and then a new server pipe is created for the next client.
//!
//! Note that the server pipes attached to clients are never given back to the
//! listener for recycling. This could possibly be implemented with a channel so
//! the listener half can re-use server pipes, but for now I err'd on the simple
//! side of things. Each stream accepted by a listener will destroy the server
//! pipe after the stream is dropped.
//!
//! This model ends up having a small race or two, and you can find more details
//! on the `native_accept` method.
//!
//! # Simultaneous reads and writes
//!
//! In testing, I found that two simultaneous writes and two simultaneous reads
//! on a pipe ended up working out just fine, but problems were encountered when
//! a read was executed simultaneously with a write. After some googling around,
//! it sounded like named pipes just weren't built for this kind of interaction,
//! and the suggested solution was to use overlapped I/O.
//!
//! I don't really know what overlapped I/O is, but my basic understanding after
//! reading about it is that you have an external Event which is used to signal
//! I/O completion, passed around in some OVERLAPPED structures. As to what this
//! is, I'm not exactly sure.
//!
//! This problem implies that all named pipes are created with the
//! FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED option. This means that all of their I/O is
//! asynchronous. Each I/O operation has an associated OVERLAPPED structure, and
//! inside of this structure is a HANDLE from CreateEvent. After the I/O is
//! determined to be pending (may complete in the future), the
//! GetOverlappedResult function is used to block on the event, waiting for the
//! I/O to finish.
//!
//! This scheme ended up working well enough. There were two snags that I ran
//! into, however:
//!
//! * Each UnixStream instance needs its own read/write events to wait on. These
//!   can't be shared among clones of the same stream because the documentation
//!   states that it unsets the event when the I/O is started (would possibly
//!   corrupt other events simultaneously waiting). For convenience's sake,
//!   these events are lazily initialized.
//!
//! * Each server pipe needs to be created with FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED in addition
//!   to all pipes created through `connect`. Notably this means that the
//!   ConnectNamedPipe function is nonblocking, implying that the Listener needs
//!   to have yet another event to do the actual blocking.
//!
//! # Conclusion
//!
//! The conclusion here is that I probably don't know the best way to work with
//! windows named pipes, but the solution here seems to work well enough to get
//! the test suite passing (the suite is in libstd), and that's good enough for
//! me!
