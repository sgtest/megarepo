by the C uv loop

communication with an active libuv loop running on a thread
somwhere in the current process

* cb - a function callback to be processed on the running loop's
thread. The only parameter is an opaque pointer to the running
uv_loop_t. You can use this pointer to initiate or continue any
operations against the loop

#[doc = "
Prepares a clean, inactive uv_loop_t* to be used with any of the
functions in the `uv::hl` module.

Library developers can use this function to prepare a given
`uv_loop_t*`, whose lifecycle they manage, to be used, ran
and controlled with the tools in this module.

After this is ran against a loop, a library developer can run
the loop in its own thread and then use the returned
`high_level_loop` to interact with it.

# Fields

* loop_ptr - a pointer to a newly created `uv_loop_t*` with no
handles registered (this will interfere with the internal lifecycle
management this module provides). Ideally, this should be called
immediately after using `uv::ll::loop_new()`

# Returns

A `high_level_loop` record that can be used to interact with the
loop (after you use `uv::ll::run()` on the `uv_loop_t*`, of course
