/*! I/O, including files, networking, timers, and processes

`std::io` provides Rust's basic I/O types,
for reading and writing to files, TCP, UDP,
and other types of sockets and pipes,
manipulating the file system, spawning processes and signal handling.

# Examples

Some examples of obvious things you might want to do

* Read lines from stdin

    ```rust
    use std::io;

    for line in io::stdin().lines() {
        print!("{}", line.unwrap());
    }
    ```

* Read a complete file

    ```rust
    use std::io::File;

    let contents = File::open(&Path::new("message.txt")).read_to_end();
    ```

* Write a line to a file

    ```rust
    # #![allow(unused_must_use)]
    use std::io::File;

    let mut file = File::create(&Path::new("message.txt"));
    file.write(bytes!("hello, file!\n"));
    # drop(file);
    # ::std::io::fs::unlink(&Path::new("message.txt"));
    ```

* Iterate over the lines of a file

    ```rust,no_run
    use std::io::BufferedReader;
    use std::io::File;

    let path = Path::new("message.txt");
    let mut file = BufferedReader::new(File::open(&path));
    for line in file.lines() {
        print!("{}", line.unwrap());
    }
    ```

* Pull the lines of a file into a vector of strings

    ```rust,no_run
    use std::io::BufferedReader;
    use std::io::File;

    let path = Path::new("message.txt");
    let mut file = BufferedReader::new(File::open(&path));
    let lines: ~[~str] = file.lines().map(|x| x.unwrap()).collect();
    ```

* Make a simple TCP client connection and request

    ```rust,should_fail
    # #![allow(unused_must_use)]
    use std::io::net::ip::SocketAddr;
    use std::io::net::tcp::TcpStream;

    let addr = from_str::<SocketAddr>("127.0.0.1:8080").unwrap();
    let mut socket = TcpStream::connect(addr).unwrap();
    socket.write(bytes!("GET / HTTP/1.0\n\n"));
    let response = socket.read_to_end();
    ```

* Make a simple TCP server

    ```rust
    # fn main() { }
    # fn foo() {
    # #![allow(dead_code)]
    use std::io::{TcpListener, TcpStream};
    use std::io::net::ip::{Ipv4Addr, SocketAddr};
    use std::io::{Acceptor, Listener};

    let addr = SocketAddr { ip: Ipv4Addr(127, 0, 0, 1), port: 80 };
    let listener = TcpListener::bind(addr);

    // bind the listener to the specified address
    let mut acceptor = listener.listen();

    fn handle_client(mut stream: TcpStream) {
        // ...
    # &mut stream; // silence unused mutability/variable warning
    }
    // accept connections and process them, spawning a new tasks for each one
    for stream in acceptor.incoming() {
        match stream {
            Err(e) => { /* connection failed */ }
            Ok(stream) => spawn(proc() {
                // connection succeeded
                handle_client(stream)
            })
        }
    }

    // close the socket server
    drop(acceptor);
    # }
    ```


# Error Handling

I/O is an area where nearly every operation can result in unexpected
errors. Errors should be painfully visible when they happen, and handling them
should be easy to work with. It should be convenient to handle specific I/O
errors, and it should also be convenient to not deal with I/O errors.

Rust's I/O employs a combination of techniques to reduce boilerplate
while still providing feedback about errors. The basic strategy:

* All I/O operations return `IoResult<T>` which is equivalent to
  `Result<T, IoError>`. The `Result` type is defined in the `std::result`
  module.
* If the `Result` type goes unused, then the compiler will by default emit a
  warning about the unused result. This is because `Result` has the
  `#[must_use]` attribute.
* Common traits are implemented for `IoResult`, e.g.
  `impl<R: Reader> Reader for IoResult<R>`, so that error values do not have
  to be 'unwrapped' before use.

These features combine in the API to allow for expressions like
`File::create(&Path::new("diary.txt")).write(bytes!("Met a girl.\n"))`
without having to worry about whether "diary.txt" exists or whether
the write succeeds. As written, if either `new` or `write_line`
encounters an error then the result of the entire expression will
be an error.

If you wanted to handle the error though you might write:

```rust
# #![allow(unused_must_use)]
use std::io::File;

match File::create(&Path::new("diary.txt")).write(bytes!("Met a girl.\n")) {
    Ok(()) => (), // succeeded
    Err(e) => println!("failed to write to my diary: {}", e),
}

# ::std::io::fs::unlink(&Path::new("diary.txt"));
```

So what actually happens if `create` encounters an error?
It's important to know that what `new` returns is not a `File`
but an `IoResult<File>`.  If the file does not open, then `new` will simply
return `Err(..)`. Because there is an implementation of `Writer` (the trait
required ultimately required for types to implement `write_line`) there is no
need to inspect or unwrap the `IoResult<File>` and we simply call `write_line`
on it. If `new` returned an `Err(..)` then the followup call to `write_line`
will also return an error.

## `try!`

Explicit pattern matching on `IoResult`s can get quite verbose, especially
when performing many I/O operations. Some examples (like those above) are
alleviated with extra methods implemented on `IoResult`, but others have more
complex interdependencies among each I/O operation.

The `try!` macro from `std::macros` is provided as a method of early-return
inside `Result`-returning functions. It expands to an early-return on `Err`
and otherwise unwraps the contained `Ok` value.

If you wanted to read several `u32`s from a file and return their product:

```rust
use std::io::{File, IoResult};

fn file_product(p: &Path) -> IoResult<u32> {
    let mut f = File::open(p);
    let x1 = try!(f.read_le_u32());
    let x2 = try!(f.read_le_u32());

    Ok(x1 * x2)
}

match file_product(&Path::new("numbers.bin")) {
    Ok(x) => println!("{}", x),
    Err(e) => println!("Failed to read numbers!")
}
```

With `try!` in `file_product`, each `read_le_u32` need not be directly
concerned with error handling; instead its caller is responsible for
responding to errors that may occur while attempting to read the numbers.
