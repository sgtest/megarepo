    // ownership violations going on here, but this is all done in the name of
    // shared state. Additionally, all of the violations are protected with a
    // mutex, so in theory there are no races.
    //
    // The first thing we need to do is to get a pointer to the task's internal
    // mutex. This address will not be changing (because the task is allocated
    // on the heap). We must have this handle separately because the task will
    // have its ownership transferred to the given closure. We're guaranteed,
    // however, that this memory will remain valid because *this* is the current
    // task's execution thread.
    //
    // The next weird part is where ownership of the task actually goes. We
    // relinquish it to the `f` blocking function, but upon returning this
    // function needs to replace the task back in TLS. There is no communication
    // from the wakeup thread back to this thread about the task pointer, and
    // there's really no need to. In order to get around this, we cast the task
    // to a `uint` which is then used at the end of this function to cast back
    // to a `Box<Task>` object. Naturally, this looks like it violates
    // ownership semantics in that there may be two `Box<Task>` objects.
    //
    // The fun part is that the wakeup half of this implementation knows to
    // "forget" the task on the other end. This means that the awakening half of
    // things silently relinquishes ownership back to this thread, but not in a
    // way that the compiler can understand. The task's memory is always valid
    // for both tasks because these operations are all done inside of a mutex.
    //
    // You'll also find that if blocking fails (the `f` function hands the
    // BlockedTask back to us), we will `mem::forget` the handles. The
    // reasoning for this is the same logic as above in that the task silently
    // transfers ownership via the `uint`, not through normal compiler
    // semantics.
    //
    // On a mildly unrelated note, it should also be pointed out that OS
    // condition variables are susceptible to spurious wakeups, which we need to
    // be ready for. In order to accommodate for this fact, we have an extra
    // `awoken` field which indicates whether we were actually woken up via some
    // invocation of `reawaken`. This flag is only ever accessed inside the
