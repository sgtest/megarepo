/*! Runtime services, including the task scheduler and I/O dispatcher

The `rt` module provides the private runtime infrastructure necessary
to support core language features like the exchange and local heap,
logging, local data and unwinding. It also implements the default task
scheduler and task model. Initialization routines are provided for setting
up runtime resources in common configurations, including that used by
`rustc` when generating executables.

It is intended that the features provided by `rt` can be factored in a
way such that the core library can be built with different 'profiles'
for different use cases, e.g. excluding the task scheduler. A number
of runtime features though are critical to the functioning of the
language and an implementation must be provided regardless of the
execution environment.

Of foremost importance is the global exchange heap, in the module
`heap`. Very little practical Rust code can be written without
access to the global heap. Unlike most of `rt` the global heap is
truly a global resource and generally operates independently of the
rest of the runtime.

All other runtime features are task-local, including the local heap,
local storage, logging and the stack unwinder.

The relationship between `rt` and the rest of the core library is
not entirely clear yet and some modules will be moving into or
out of `rt` as development proceeds.

Several modules in `core` are clients of `rt`:

* `std::task` - The user-facing interface to the Rust task model.
* `std::local_data` - The interface to local data.
* `std::unstable::lang` - Miscellaneous lang items, some of which rely on `std::rt`.
* `std::cleanup` - Local heap destruction.
* `std::io` - In the future `std::io` will use an `rt` implementation.
* `std::logging`
* `std::comm`
