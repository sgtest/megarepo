//! A native mutex and condition variable type.
//!
//! This module contains bindings to the platform's native mutex/condition
//! variable primitives. It provides two types: `StaticNativeMutex`, which can
//! be statically initialized via the `NATIVE_MUTEX_INIT` value, and a simple
//! wrapper `NativeMutex` that has a destructor to clean up after itself. These
//! objects serve as both mutexes and condition variables simultaneously.
//!
//! The static lock is lazily initialized, but it can only be unsafely
//! destroyed. A statically initialized lock doesn't necessarily have a time at
//! which it can get deallocated. For this reason, there is no `Drop`
//! implementation of the static mutex, but rather the `destroy()` method must
//! be invoked manually if destruction of the mutex is desired.
//!
//! The non-static `NativeMutex` type does have a destructor, but cannot be
//! statically initialized.
//!
//! It is not recommended to use this type for idiomatic rust use. These types
//! are appropriate where no other options are available, but other rust
//! concurrency primitives should be used before them: the `sync` crate defines
//! `StaticMutex` and `Mutex` types.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::unstable::mutex::{NativeMutex, StaticNativeMutex, NATIVE_MUTEX_INIT};
//!
//! // Use a statically initialized mutex
//! static mut LOCK: StaticNativeMutex = NATIVE_MUTEX_INIT;
//!
//! unsafe {
//!     let _guard = LOCK.lock();
//! } // automatically unlocked here
//!
//! // Use a normally initialized mutex
//! unsafe {
//!     let mut lock = NativeMutex::new();
//!
//!     {
//!         let _guard = lock.lock();
//!     } // unlocked here
//!
//!     // sometimes the RAII guard isn't appropriate
//!     lock.lock_noguard();
//!     lock.unlock_noguard();
//! } // `lock` is deallocated here
//! ```
