//! A native mutex and condition variable type
//!
//! This module contains bindings to the platform's native mutex/condition
//! variable primitives. It provides a single type, `Mutex`, which can be
//! statically initialized via the `MUTEX_INIT` value. This object serves as both a
//! mutex and a condition variable simultaneously.
//!
//! The lock is lazily initialized, but it can only be unsafely destroyed. A
//! statically initialized lock doesn't necessarily have a time at which it can
//! get deallocated. For this reason, there is no `Drop` implementation of the
//! mutex, but rather the `destroy()` method must be invoked manually if
//! destruction of the mutex is desired.
//!
//! It is not recommended to use this type for idiomatic rust use. This type is
//! appropriate where no other options are available, but other rust concurrency
//! primitives should be used before this type.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//!     use std::unstable::mutex::{Mutex, MUTEX_INIT};
//!
//!     // Use a statically initialized mutex
//!     static mut lock: Mutex = MUTEX_INIT;
//!
//!     unsafe {
//!         lock.lock();
//!         lock.unlock();
//!     }
//!
//!     // Use a normally initialized mutex
//!     let mut lock = Mutex::new();
//!     unsafe {
//!         lock.lock();
//!         lock.unlock();
//!         lock.destroy();
//!     }
