# Atomics

The atomic intrinsics provide common atomic operations on machine
words, with multiple possible memory orderings. They obey the same
semantics as C++0x. See the LLVM documentation on [[atomics]].

[atomics]: http://llvm.org/docs/Atomics.html

A quick refresher on memory ordering:

* Acquire - a barrier for aquiring a lock. Subsequent reads and writes
  take place after the barrier.
* Release - a barrier for releasing a lock. Preceding reads and writes
  take place before the barrier.
* Sequentially consistent - sequentially consistent operations are
  guaranteed to happen in order. This is the standard mode for working
  with atomic types and is equivalent to Java's `volatile`.
