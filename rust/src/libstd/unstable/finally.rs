The Finally trait provides a method, `finally` on
stack closures that emulates Java-style try/finally blocks.

Using the `finally` method is sometimes convenient, but the type rules
prohibit any shared, mutable state between the "try" case and the
"finally" case. For advanced cases, the `try_finally` function can
also be used. See that function for more details.

# Example

 ```
(|| {
    ...
}).finally(|| {
    always_run_this();
})
 ```

#[cfg(test)] use task::failing;

pub trait Finally<T> {
    fn finally(&self, dtor: ||) -> T;
}

impl<'a,T> Finally<T> for 'a || -> T {
    fn finally(&self, dtor: ||) -> T {
        try_finally(&mut (), (),
                    |_, _| (*self)(),
                    |_| dtor())
    }
}

impl<T> Finally<T> for fn() -> T {
    fn finally(&self, dtor: ||) -> T {
        try_finally(&mut (), (),

                    |_| dtor())
    }

/**
 * The most general form of the `finally` functions. The function
 * `try_fn` will be invoked first; whether or not it fails, the
 * function `finally_fn` will be invoked next. The two parameters
 * `mutate` and `drop` are used to thread state through the two
 * closures. `mutate` is used for any shared, mutable state that both
 * closures require access to; `drop` is used for any state that the
 * `try_fn` requires ownership of.
 *
 * **WARNING:** While shared, mutable state between the try and finally
 * function is often necessary, one must be very careful; the `try`
 * function could have failed at any point, so the values of the shared
 * state may be inconsistent.
 *
 * # Example
 *
 * ```
 * struct State<'a> { buffer: &'a mut [u8], len: uint }
 * let mut state = State { buffer: buf, len: 0 };
 * try_finally(
 *     &mut state, (),
 *     |state, ()| {
 *         // use state.buffer, state.len
 *     }
 *     |state| {
 *         // use state.buffer, state.len to cleanup
 *     })
 * ```
