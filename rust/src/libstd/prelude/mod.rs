//! The Rust prelude
//!
//! Because `std` is required by most serious Rust software, it is
//! imported at the topmost level of every crate by default, as if the
//! first line of each crate was
//!
//! ```ignore
//! extern crate std;
//! ```
//!
//! This means that the contents of std can be accessed from any context
//! with the `std::` path prefix, as in `use std::vec`, `use std::thread::spawn`,
//! etc.
//!
//! Additionally, `std` contains a `prelude` module that reexports many of the
//! most common traits, types and functions. The contents of the prelude are
//! imported into every *module* by default.  Implicitly, all modules behave as if
//! they contained the following prologue:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use std::prelude::v1::*;
//! ```
//!
//! The prelude is primarily concerned with exporting *traits* that are so
//! pervasive that it would be obnoxious to import for every use, particularly
//! those that define methods on primitive types.
