/// A Condition Variable
///
/// Condition variables represent the ability to block a thread such that it
/// consumes no CPU time while waiting for an event to occur. Condition
/// variables are typically associated with a boolean predicate (a condition)
/// and a mutex. The predicate is always verified inside of the mutex before
/// determining that thread must block.
///
/// Functions in this module will block the current **thread** of execution and
/// are bindings to system-provided condition variables where possible. Note
/// that this module places one additional restriction over the system condition
/// variables: each condvar can be used with precisely one mutex at runtime. Any
/// attempt to use multiple mutexes on the same condition variable will result
/// in a runtime panic. If this is not desired, then the unsafe primitives in
/// `sys` do not have this restriction but may result in undefined behavior.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex, Condvar};
///
/// let pair = Arc::new((Mutex::new(false), Condvar::new()));
/// let pair2 = pair.clone();
///
/// // Inside of our lock, spawn a new thread, and then wait for it to start
/// spawn(move|| {
///     let &(ref lock, ref cvar) = &*pair2;
///     let mut started = lock.lock();
///     *started = true;
///     cvar.notify_one();
/// });
///
/// // wait for the thread to start up
/// let &(ref lock, ref cvar) = &*pair;
/// let started = lock.lock();
/// while !*started {
///     cvar.wait(&started);
/// }
/// ```
