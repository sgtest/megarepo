/// `new` constructor.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use std::sync::mutex::Mutex;
///
/// let m = Mutex::new();
/// let guard = m.lock();
/// // do some work
/// drop(guard); // unlock the lock
/// ```

    // StaticNativeMutex inside the static mutex above. Once a native mutex has
    // been used once, its address can never change (it can't be moved). This
    // mutex type can be safely moved at any time, so to ensure that the native
    // mutex is used correctly we box the inner lock to give it a constant
    // address.

/// destructors. As a result, a `StaticMutex` has one extra method when compared
/// to a `Mutex`, a `destroy` method. This method is unsafe to call, and
/// documentation can be found directly on the method.

///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use std::sync::mutex::{StaticMutex, MUTEX_INIT};
///
/// static LOCK: StaticMutex = MUTEX_INIT;
///
/// {
///     let _g = LOCK.lock();
///     // do some productive work
/// }
/// // lock is unlocked here.
