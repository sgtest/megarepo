/// A reader-writer lock
///
/// This type of lock allows a number of readers or at most one writer at any
/// point in time. The write portion of this lock typically allows modification
/// of the underlying data (exclusive access) and the read portion of this lock
/// typically allows for read-only access (shared access).
///
/// The type parameter `T` represents the data that this lock protects. It is
/// required that `T` satisfies `Send` to be shared across tasks and `Sync` to
/// allow concurrent access through readers. The RAII guards returned from the
/// locking methods implement `Deref` (and `DerefMut` for the `write` methods)
/// to allow access to the contained of the lock.
///
/// RWLocks, like Mutexes, will become poisoned on panics. Note, however, that
/// an RWLock may only be poisoned if a panic occurs while it is locked
/// exclusively (write mode). If a panic occurs in any reader, then the lock
/// will not be poisoned.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use std::sync::RWLock;
///
/// let lock = RWLock::new(5i);
///
/// // many reader locks can be held at once
/// {
///     let r1 = lock.read();
///     let r2 = lock.read();
///     assert_eq!(*r1, 5);
///     assert_eq!(*r2, 5);
/// } // read locks are dropped at this point
///
/// // only one write lock may be held, however
/// {
///     let mut w = lock.write();
///     *w += 1;
///     assert_eq!(*w, 6);
/// } // write lock is dropped here
/// ```
