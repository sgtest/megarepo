//! Useful synchronization primitives.

//! This module contains useful safe and unsafe synchronization primitives.
//! Most of the primitives in this module do not provide any sort of locking
//! and/or blocking at all, but rather provide the necessary tools to build
//! other types of concurrent primitives.
