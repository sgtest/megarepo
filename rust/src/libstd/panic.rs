/// A marker trait which represents "panic safe" types in Rust.
///
/// This trait is implemented by default for many types and behaves similarly in
/// terms of inference of implementation to the `Send` and `Sync` traits. The
/// purpose of this trait is to encode what types are safe to cross a `recover`
/// boundary with no fear of panic safety.
///
/// ## What is panic safety?
///
/// In Rust a function can "return" early if it either panics or calls a
/// function which transitively panics. This sort of control flow is not always
/// anticipated, and has the possibility of causing subtle bugs through a
/// combination of two cricial components:
///
/// 1. A data structure is in a temporarily invalid state when the thread
///    panics.
/// 2. This broken invariant is then later observed.
///
/// Typically in Rust, it is difficult to perform step (2) because catching a
/// panic involves either spawning a thread (which in turns makes it difficult
/// to later witness broken invariants) or using the `recover` function in this
/// module. Additionally, even if an invariant is witnessed, it typically isn't a
/// problem in Rust because there's no uninitialized values (like in C or C++).
///
/// It is possible, however, for **logical** invariants to be broken in Rust,
/// which can end up causing behavioral bugs. Another key aspect of panic safety
/// in Rust is that, in the absence of `unsafe` code, a panic cannot lead to
/// memory unsafety.
///
/// That was a bit of a whirlwind tour of panic safety, but for more information
/// about panic safety and how it applies to Rust, see an [associated RFC][rfc].
///
/// [rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1236-stabilize-catch-panic.md
///
/// ## What is `UnwindSafe`?
///
/// Now that we've got an idea of what panic safety is in Rust, it's also
/// important to understand what this trait represents. As mentioned above, one
/// way to witness broken invariants is through the `recover` function in this
/// module as it allows catching a panic and then re-using the environment of
/// the closure.
///
/// Simply put, a type `T` implements `UnwindSafe` if it cannot easily allow
/// witnessing a broken invariant through the use of `recover` (catching a
/// panic). This trait is a marker trait, so it is automatically implemented for
/// many types, and it is also structurally composed (e.g. a struct is recover
/// safe if all of its components are recover safe).
///
/// Note, however, that this is not an unsafe trait, so there is not a succinct
/// contract that this trait is providing. Instead it is intended as more of a
/// "speed bump" to alert users of `recover` that broken invariants may be
/// witnessed and may need to be accounted for.
///
/// ## Who implements `UnwindSafe`?
///
/// Types such as `&mut T` and `&RefCell<T>` are examples which are **not**
/// recover safe. The general idea is that any mutable state which can be shared
/// across `recover` is not recover safe by default. This is because it is very
/// easy to witness a broken invariant outside of `recover` as the data is
/// simply accessed as usual.
///
/// Types like `&Mutex<T>`, however, are recover safe because they implement
/// poisoning by default. They still allow witnessing a broken invariant, but
/// they already provide their own "speed bumps" to do so.
///
/// ## When should `UnwindSafe` be used?
///
/// Is not intended that most types or functions need to worry about this trait.
/// It is only used as a bound on the `recover` function and as mentioned above,
/// the lack of `unsafe` means it is mostly an advisory. The `AssertUnwindSafe`
/// wrapper struct in this module can be used to force this trait to be
/// implemented for any closed over variables passed to the `recover` function
/// (more on this below).

/// A simple wrapper around a type to assert that it is panic safe.
///
/// When using `recover` it may be the case that some of the closed over
/// variables are not panic safe. For example if `&mut T` is captured the
/// compiler will generate a warning indicating that it is not panic safe. It
/// may not be the case, however, that this is actually a problem due to the
/// specific usage of `recover` if panic safety is specifically taken into
/// account. This wrapper struct is useful for a quick and lightweight
/// annotation that a variable is indeed panic safe.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// One way to use `AssertUnwindSafe` is to assert that the entire closure
/// itself is recover safe, bypassing all checks for all variables:
///
/// ```
/// use std::panic::{self, AssertUnwindSafe};
///
/// let mut variable = 4;
///
/// // This code will not compile because the closure captures `&mut variable`
/// // which is not considered panic safe by default.
///
/// // panic::catch_unwind(|| {
/// //     variable += 3;
/// // });
///
/// // This, however, will compile due to the `AssertUnwindSafe` wrapper
/// let result = panic::catch_unwind(AssertUnwindSafe(|| {
///     variable += 3;
/// }));
/// // ...
/// ```
///
/// Wrapping the entire closure amounts to a blanket assertion that all captured
/// variables are unwind safe. This has the downside that if new captures are
/// added in the future, they will also be considered unwind safe. Therefore,
/// you may prefer to just wrap individual captures, as shown below. This is
/// more annotation, but it ensures that if a new capture is added which is not
/// unwind safe, you will get a compilation error at that time, which will
/// allow you to consider whether that new capture in fact represent a bug or
/// not.
///
/// ```
/// use std::panic::{self, AssertUnwindSafe};
///
/// let mut variable = 4;
/// let other_capture = 3;
///
/// let result = {
///     let mut wrapper = AssertUnwindSafe(&mut variable);
///     panic::catch_unwind(move || {
///         **wrapper += other_capture;
///     })
