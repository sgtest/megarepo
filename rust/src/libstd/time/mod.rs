/// words each tick of the underlying clock may not be the same length (e.g.
/// some seconds may be longer than others). An instant may jump forwards or
/// experience time dilation (slow down or speed up), but it will never go
/// backwards.

/// allow learning the duration between two instants (or comparing two
/// instants).
