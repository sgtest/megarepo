//! Utilities for random number generation
//!
//! The key functions are `random()` and `Rng::gen()`. These are polymorphic
//! and so can be used to generate any type that implements `Rand`. Type inference
//! means that often a simple call to `rand::random()` or `rng.gen()` will
//! suffice, but sometimes an annotation is required, e.g. `rand::random::<f64>()`.
//!
//! See the `distributions` submodule for sampling random numbers from
//! distributions like normal and exponential.
//!
//! # Thread-local RNG
//!
//! There is built-in support for a RNG associated with each thread stored
//! in thread-local storage. This RNG can be accessed via `thread_rng`, or
//! used implicitly via `random`. This RNG is normally randomly seeded
//! from an operating-system source of randomness, e.g. `/dev/urandom` on
//! Unix systems, and will automatically reseed itself from this source
//! after generating 32 KiB of random data.
//!
//! # Cryptographic security
//!
//! An application that requires an entropy source for cryptographic purposes
//! must use `OsRng`, which reads randomness from the source that the operating
//! system provides (e.g. `/dev/urandom` on Unixes or `CryptGenRandom()` on Windows).
//! The other random number generators provided by this module are not suitable
//! for such purposes.
//!
//! *Note*: many Unix systems provide `/dev/random` as well as `/dev/urandom`.
//! This module uses `/dev/urandom` for the following reasons:
//!
//! -   On Linux, `/dev/random` may block if entropy pool is empty; `/dev/urandom` will not block.
//!     This does not mean that `/dev/random` provides better output than
//!     `/dev/urandom`; the kernel internally runs a cryptographically secure pseudorandom
//!     number generator (CSPRNG) based on entropy pool for random number generation,
//!     so the "quality" of `/dev/random` is not better than `/dev/urandom` in most cases.
//!     However, this means that `/dev/urandom` can yield somewhat predictable randomness
//!     if the entropy pool is very small, such as immediately after first booting.
//!     Linux 3.17 added the `getrandom(2)` system call which solves the issue: it blocks if entropy
//!     pool is not initialized yet, but it does not block once initialized.
//!     `getrandom(2)` was based on `getentropy(2)`, an existing system call in OpenBSD.
//!     `OsRng` tries to use `getrandom(2)` if available, and use `/dev/urandom` fallback if not.
//!     If an application does not have `getrandom` and likely to be run soon after first booting,
//!     or on a system with very few entropy sources, one should consider using `/dev/random` via
//!     `ReaderRng`.
//! -   On some systems (e.g. FreeBSD, OpenBSD and macOS) there is no difference
//!     between the two sources. (Also note that, on some systems e.g. FreeBSD, both `/dev/random`
//!     and `/dev/urandom` may block once if the CSPRNG has not seeded yet.)
