//! Native threads.
//!
//! ## The threading model
//!
//! An executing Rust program consists of a collection of native OS threads,
//! each with their own stack and local state. Threads can be named, and
//! provide some built-in support for low-level synchronization.
//!
//! Communication between threads can be done through
//! [channels](../../std/sync/mpsc/index.html), Rust's message-passing
//! types, along with [other forms of thread
//! synchronization](../../std/sync/index.html) and shared-memory data
//! structures. In particular, types that are guaranteed to be
//! threadsafe are easily shared between threads using the
//! atomically-reference-counted container,
//! [`Arc`](../../std/sync/struct.Arc.html).
//!
//! Fatal logic errors in Rust cause *thread panic*, during which
//! a thread will unwind the stack, running destructors and freeing
//! owned resources. Thread panic is unrecoverable from within
//! the panicking thread (i.e. there is no 'try/catch' in Rust), but
//! the panic may optionally be detected from a different thread. If
//! the main thread panics, the application will exit with a non-zero
//! exit code.
//!
//! When the main thread of a Rust program terminates, the entire program shuts
//! down, even if other threads are still running. However, this module provides
//! convenient facilities for automatically waiting for the termination of a
//! child thread (i.e., join).
//!
//! ## Spawning a thread
//!
//! A new thread can be spawned using the `thread::spawn` function:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::thread;
//!
//! thread::spawn(move || {
//!     // some work here
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! In this example, the spawned thread is "detached" from the current
//! thread. This means that it can outlive its parent (the thread that spawned
//! it), unless this parent is the main thread.
//!
//! The parent thread can also wait on the completion of the child
//! thread; a call to `spawn` produces a `JoinHandle`, which provides
//! a `join` method for waiting:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::thread;
//!
//! let child = thread::spawn(move || {
//!     // some work here
//! });
//! // some work here
//! let res = child.join();
//! ```
//!
//! The `join` method returns a `Result` containing `Ok` of the final
//! value produced by the child thread, or `Err` of the value given to
//! a call to `panic!` if the child panicked.
//!
//! ## Configuring threads
//!
//! A new thread can be configured before it is spawned via the `Builder` type,
//! which currently allows you to set the name and stack size for the child thread:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #![allow(unused_must_use)]
//! use std::thread;
//!
//! thread::Builder::new().name("child1".to_string()).spawn(move || {
//!     println!("Hello, world!");
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! ## The `Thread` type
//!
//! Threads are represented via the `Thread` type, which you can get in one of
//! two ways:
//!
//! * By spawning a new thread, e.g. using the `thread::spawn` function, and
//!   calling `thread()` on the `JoinHandle`.
//! * By requesting the current thread, using the `thread::current` function.
//!
//! The `thread::current()` function is available even for threads not spawned
//! by the APIs of this module.
//!
//! ## Blocking support: park and unpark
//!
//! Every thread is equipped with some basic low-level blocking support, via the
//! `thread::park()` function and `thread::Thread::unpark()` method. `park()`
//! blocks the current thread, which can then be resumed from another thread by
//! calling the `unpark()` method on the blocked thread's handle.
//!
//! Conceptually, each `Thread` handle has an associated token, which is
//! initially not present:
//!
//! * The `thread::park()` function blocks the current thread unless or until
//!   the token is available for its thread handle, at which point it atomically
//!   consumes the token. It may also return *spuriously*, without consuming the
//!   token. `thread::park_timeout()` does the same, but allows specifying a
//!   maximum time to block the thread for.
//!
//! * The `unpark()` method on a `Thread` atomically makes the token available
//!   if it wasn't already.
//!
//! In other words, each `Thread` acts a bit like a semaphore with initial count
//! 0, except that the semaphore is *saturating* (the count cannot go above 1),
//! and can return spuriously.
//!
//! The API is typically used by acquiring a handle to the current thread,
//! placing that handle in a shared data structure so that other threads can
//! find it, and then `park`ing. When some desired condition is met, another
//! thread calls `unpark` on the handle.
//!
//! The motivation for this design is twofold:
//!
//! * It avoids the need to allocate mutexes and condvars when building new
//!   synchronization primitives; the threads already provide basic blocking/signaling.
//!
//! * It can be implemented very efficiently on many platforms.
//!
//! ## Thread-local storage
//!
//! This module also provides an implementation of thread local storage for Rust
//! programs. Thread local storage is a method of storing data into a global
//! variable which each thread in the program will have its own copy of.
//! Threads do not share this data, so accesses do not need to be synchronized.
//!
//! At a high level, this module provides two variants of storage:
//!
//! * Owned thread-local storage. This is a type of thread local key which
//!   owns the value that it contains, and will destroy the value when the
//!   thread exits. This variant is created with the `thread_local!` macro and
//!   can contain any value which is `'static` (no borrowed pointers).
//!
//! * Scoped thread-local storage. This type of key is used to store a reference
//!   to a value into local storage temporarily for the scope of a function
//!   call. There are no restrictions on what types of values can be placed
//!   into this key.
//!
//! Both forms of thread local storage provide an accessor function, `with`,
//! which will yield a shared reference to the value to the specified
//! closure. Thread-local keys only allow shared access to values as there is no
//! way to guarantee uniqueness if a mutable borrow was allowed. Most values
//! will want to make use of some form of **interior mutability** through the
//! `Cell` or `RefCell` types.
