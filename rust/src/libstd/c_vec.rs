/*!
 * Library to interface with chunks of memory allocated in C.
 *
 * It is often desirable to safely interface with memory allocated from C,
 * encapsulating the unsafety into allocation and destruction time.  Indeed,
 * allocating memory externally is currently the only way to give Rust shared
 * mut state with C programs that keep their own references; vectors are
 * unsuitable because they could be reallocated or moved at any time, and
 * importing C memory into a vector takes a one-time snapshot of the memory.
 *
 * This module simplifies the usage of such external blocks of memory.  Memory
 * is encapsulated into an opaque object after creation; the lifecycle of the
 * memory can be optionally managed by Rust, if an appropriate destructor
 * closure is provided.  Safety is ensured by bounds-checking accesses, which
 * are marshalled through get and set functions.
 *
 * There are three unsafe functions: the two introduction forms, and the
 * pointer elimination form.  The introduction forms are unsafe for the
 * obvious reason (they act on a pointer that cannot be checked inside the
 * method), but the elimination form is somewhat more subtle in its unsafety.
 * By using a pointer taken from a c_vec::t without keeping a reference to the
 * c_vec::t itself around, the CVec could be garbage collected, and the
 * memory within could be destroyed.  There are legitimate uses for the
 * pointer elimination form -- for instance, to pass memory back into C -- but
 * great care must be taken to ensure that a reference to the c_vec::t is
 * still held if needed.
