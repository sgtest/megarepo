// The task-local-map stores all TLS information for the currently running task.
// It is stored as an owned pointer into the runtime, and it's only allocated
// when TLS is used for the first time. This map must be very carefully
// constructed because it has many mutable loans unsoundly handed out on it to
// the various invocations of TLS requests.
//
// One of the most important operations is loaning a value via `get` to a
// caller. In doing so, the slot that the TLS entry is occupying cannot be
// invalidated because upon returning it's loan state must be updated. Currently
// the TLS map is a vector, but this is possibly dangerous because the vector
// can be reallocated/moved when new values are pushed onto it.
//
// This problem currently isn't solved in a very elegant way. Inside the `get`
// function, it internally "invalidates" all references after the loan is
// finished and looks up into the vector again. In theory this will prevent
// pointers from being moved under our feet so long as LLVM doesn't go too crazy
// with the optimizations.
//
// n.b. Other structures are not sufficient right now:
//          * HashMap uses ~[T] internally (push reallocates/moves)
//          * TreeMap is plausible, but it's in extra
//          * dlist plausible, but not in std
//          * a custom owned linked list was attempted, but difficult to write
//            and involved a lot of extra code bloat
//
// n.b. Has to be stored with a pointer at outermost layer; the foreign call
//      returns void *.
//
// n.b. If TLS is used heavily in future, this could be made more efficient with
//      a proper map.
