//! The `()` type, sometimes called "unit" or "nil".
//!
//! The `()` type has exactly one value `()`, and is used when there
//! is no other meaningful value that could be returned. `()` is most
//! commonly seen implicitly: functions without a `-> ...` implicitly
//! have return type `()`, that is, these are equivalent:
//!
//! ```rust
//! fn long() -> () {}
//!
//! fn short() {}
//! ```
//!
//! The semicolon `;` can be used to discard the result of an
//! expression at the end of a block, making the expression (and thus
//! the block) evaluate to `()`. For example,
//!
//! ```rust
//! fn returns_i64() -> i64 {
//!     1i64
//! }
//! fn returns_unit() {
//!     1i64;
//! }
//!
//! let is_i64 = {
//!     returns_i64()
//! };
//! let is_unit = {
//!     returns_i64();
//! };
//! ```
