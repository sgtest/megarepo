//! Native threads
//!
//! ## The threading model
//!
//! An executing Rust program consists of a collection of native OS threads,
//! each with their own stack and local state.
//!
//! Communication between threads can be done through
//! [channels](../../std/comm/index.html), Rust's message-passing
//! types, along with [other forms of thread
//! synchronization](../../std/sync/index.html) and shared-memory data
//! structures. In particular, types that are guaranteed to be
//! threadsafe are easily shared between threads using the
//! atomically-reference-counted container,
//! [`Arc`](../../std/sync/struct.Arc.html).
//!
//! Fatal logic errors in Rust cause *thread panic*, during which
//! a thread will unwind the stack, running destructors and freeing
//! owned resources. Thread panic is unrecoverable from within
//! the panicking thread (i.e. there is no 'try/catch' in Rust), but
//! panic may optionally be detected from a different thread. If
//! the main thread panics the application will exit with a non-zero
//! exit code.
//!
//! When the main thread of a Rust program terminates, the entire program shuts
//! down, even if other threads are still running. However, this module provides
//! convenient facilities for automatically waiting for the termination of a
//! child thread (i.e., join), described below.
//!
//! ## The `Thread` type
//!
//! Already-running threads are represented via the `Thread` type, which you can
//! get in one of two ways:
//!
//! * By spawning a new thread, e.g. using the `Thread::spawn` constructor;
//! * By requesting the current thread, using the `Thread::current` function.
//!
//! Threads can be named, and provide some built-in support for low-level
//! synchronization described below.
//!
//! The `Thread::current()` function is available even for threads not spawned
//! by the APIs of this module.
//!
//! ## Spawning a thread
//!
//! A new thread can be spawned using the `Thread::spawn` function:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::thread::Thread;
//!
//! let guard = Thread::spawn(move || {
//!     println!("Hello, World!");
//!     // some computation here
//! });
//! let result = guard.join();
//! ```
//!
//! The `spawn` function doesn't return a `Thread` directly; instead, it returns
//! a *join guard* from which a `Thread` can be extracted. The join guard is an
//! RAII-style guard that will automatically join the child thread (block until
//! it terminates) when it is dropped. You can join the child thread in advance
//! by calling the `join` method on the guard, which will also return the result
//! produced by the thread.
//!
//! If you instead wish to *detach* the child thread, allowing it to outlive its
//! parent, you can use the `detach` method on the guard,
//!
//! A handle to the thread itself is available via the `thread` method on the
//! join guard.
//!
//! ## Configuring threads
//!
//! A new thread can be configured before it is spawned via the `Builder` type,
//! which currently allows you to set the name, stack size, and writers for
//! `println!` and `panic!` for the child thread:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::thread;
//!
//! thread::Builder::new().name("child1".to_string()).spawn(move || {
//!     println!("Hello, world!")
//! }).detach();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Blocking support: park and unpark
//!
//! Every thread is equipped with some basic low-level blocking support, via the
//! `park` and `unpark` functions.
//!
//! Conceptually, each `Thread` handle has an associated token, which is
//! initially not present:
//!
//! * The `Thread::park()` function blocks the current thread unless or until
//!   the token is available for its thread handle, at which point It atomically
//!   consumes the token. It may also return *spuriously*, without consuming the
//!   token.
//!
//! * The `unpark()` method on a `Thread` atomically makes the token available
//!   if it wasn't already.
//!
//! In other words, each `Thread` acts a bit like a semaphore with initial count
//! 0, except that the semaphore is *saturating* (the count cannot go above 1),
//! and can return spuriously.
//!
//! The API is typically used by acquiring a handle to the current thread,
//! placing that handle in a shared data structure so that other threads can
//! find it, and then `park`ing. When some desired condition is met, another
//! thread calls `unpark` on the handle.
//!
//! The motivation for this design is twofold:
//!
//! * It avoids the need to allocate mutexes and condvars when building new
//!   synchronization primitives; the threads already provide basic blocking/signaling.
//!
//! * It can be implemented highly efficiently on many platforms.
