//! Native threads
//!
//! ## The threading model
//!
//! An executing Rust program consists of a collection of native OS threads,
//! each with their own stack and local state.
//!
//! Communication between threads can be done through
//! [channels](../../std/sync/mpsc/index.html), Rust's message-passing
//! types, along with [other forms of thread
//! synchronization](../../std/sync/index.html) and shared-memory data
//! structures. In particular, types that are guaranteed to be
//! threadsafe are easily shared between threads using the
//! atomically-reference-counted container,
//! [`Arc`](../../std/sync/struct.Arc.html).
//!
//! Fatal logic errors in Rust cause *thread panic*, during which
//! a thread will unwind the stack, running destructors and freeing
//! owned resources. Thread panic is unrecoverable from within
//! the panicking thread (i.e. there is no 'try/catch' in Rust), but
//! the panic may optionally be detected from a different thread. If
//! the main thread panics, the application will exit with a non-zero
//! exit code.
//!
//! When the main thread of a Rust program terminates, the entire program shuts
//! down, even if other threads are still running. However, this module provides
//! convenient facilities for automatically waiting for the termination of a
//! child thread (i.e., join).
//!
//! ## The `Thread` type
//!
//! Threads are represented via the `Thread` type, which you can
//! get in one of two ways:
//!
//! * By spawning a new thread, e.g. using the `thread::spawn` function.
//! * By requesting the current thread, using the `thread::current` function.
//!
//! Threads can be named, and provide some built-in support for low-level
//! synchronization (described below).
//!
//! The `thread::current()` function is available even for threads not spawned
//! by the APIs of this module.
//!
//! ## Spawning a thread
//!
//! A new thread can be spawned using the `thread::spawn` function:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::thread;
//!
//! thread::spawn(move || {
//!     // some work here
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! In this example, the spawned thread is "detached" from the current
//! thread. This means that it can outlive its parent (the thread that spawned
//! it), unless this parent is the main thread.
//!
//! ## Scoped threads
//!
//! Often a parent thread uses a child thread to perform some particular task,
//! and at some point must wait for the child to complete before continuing.
//! For this scenario, use the `thread::scoped` function:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::thread;
//!
//! let guard = thread::scoped(move || {
//!     // some work here
//! });
//!
//! // do some other work in the meantime
//! let output = guard.join();
//! ```
//!
//! The `scoped` function doesn't return a `Thread` directly; instead,
//! it returns a *join guard*. The join guard is an RAII-style guard
//! that will automatically join the child thread (block until it
//! terminates) when it is dropped. You can join the child thread in
//! advance by calling the `join` method on the guard, which will also
//! return the result produced by the thread.  A handle to the thread
//! itself is available via the `thread` method of the join guard.
//!
//! ## Configuring threads
//!
//! A new thread can be configured before it is spawned via the `Builder` type,
//! which currently allows you to set the name, stack size, and writers for
//! `println!` and `panic!` for the child thread:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::thread;
//!
//! thread::Builder::new().name("child1".to_string()).spawn(move || {
//!     println!("Hello, world!");
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! ## Blocking support: park and unpark
//!
//! Every thread is equipped with some basic low-level blocking support, via the
//! `park` and `unpark` functions.
//!
//! Conceptually, each `Thread` handle has an associated token, which is
//! initially not present:
//!
//! * The `thread::park()` function blocks the current thread unless or until
//!   the token is available for its thread handle, at which point it atomically
//!   consumes the token. It may also return *spuriously*, without consuming the
//!   token. `thread::park_timeout()` does the same, but allows specifying a
//!   maximum time to block the thread for.
//!
//! * The `unpark()` method on a `Thread` atomically makes the token available
//!   if it wasn't already.
//!
//! In other words, each `Thread` acts a bit like a semaphore with initial count
//! 0, except that the semaphore is *saturating* (the count cannot go above 1),
//! and can return spuriously.
//!
//! The API is typically used by acquiring a handle to the current thread,
//! placing that handle in a shared data structure so that other threads can
//! find it, and then `park`ing. When some desired condition is met, another
//! thread calls `unpark` on the handle.
//!
//! The motivation for this design is twofold:
//!
//! * It avoids the need to allocate mutexes and condvars when building new
//!   synchronization primitives; the threads already provide basic blocking/signaling.
//!
//! * It can be implemented very efficiently on many platforms.
