Communication between tasks

Communication between tasks is facilitated by ports (in the receiving task),
and channels (in the sending task). Any number of channels may feed into a
single port.

Ports and channels may only transmit values of unique types; that is,
values that are statically guaranteed to be accessed by a single
'owner' at a time.  Unique types include scalars, vectors, strings,
and records, tags, tuples and unique boxes (~T) thereof. Most notably,
shared boxes (@T) may not be transmitted across channels.

Example:

> use std::task;
> use std::comm;
>
> let p = comm::port();
> task::spawn(comm::chan(p), fn (c: chan<str>) {
>   comm::send(c, "Hello, World");
> });
>
> log comm::recv(p);

/*
Type: chan

A communication endpoint that can send messages. Channels send
messages to ports.

Each channel is bound to a port when the channel is constructed, so
the destination port for a channel must exist before the channel
itself.

Channels are weak: a channel does not keep the port it is bound to alive.
If a channel attempts to send data to a dead port that data will be silently
dropped.

Channels may be duplicated and themselves transmitted over other channels.

/*
Type: port

A communication endpoint that can receive messages. Ports receive
messages from channels.

Each port has a unique per-task identity and may not be replicated or
transmitted. If a port value is copied, both copies refer to the same port.

Ports may be associated with multiple <chan>s.
