//! The native I/O and threading crate
//!
//! This crate contains an implementation of 1:1 scheduling for a "native"
//! runtime. In addition, all I/O provided by this crate is the thread blocking
//! version of I/O.
//!
//! # Starting with libnative
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate native;
//!
//! #[start]
//! fn start(argc: int, argv: **u8) -> int { native::start(argc, argv, main) }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // this code is running on the main OS thread
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Force spawning a native task
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate native;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // We're not sure whether this main function is run in 1:1 or M:N mode.
//!
//!     native::task::spawn(proc() {
//!         // this code is guaranteed to be run on a native thread
//!     });
//! }
//! ```
