//! Implementation of the helper thread for the timer module
//!
//! This module contains the management necessary for the timer worker thread.
//! This thread is responsible for performing the send()s on channels for timers
//! that are using channels instead of a blocking call.
//!
//! The timer thread is lazily initialized, and it's shut down via the
//! `shutdown` function provided. It must be maintained as an invariant that
//! `shutdown` is only called when the entire program is finished. No new timers
//! can be created in the future and there must be no active timers at that
//! time.
