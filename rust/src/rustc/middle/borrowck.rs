# Borrow check

This pass is in job of enforcing *memory safety* and *purity*.  As
memory safety is by far the more complex topic, I'll focus on that in
this description, but purity will be covered later on. In the context
of Rust, memory safety means three basic things:

- no writes to immutable memory;
- all pointers point to non-freed memory;
- all pointers point to memory of the same type as the pointer.

The last point might seem confusing: after all, for the most part,
this condition is guaranteed by the type check.  However, there are
two cases where the type check effectively delegates to borrow check.

The first case has to do with enums.  If there is a pointer to the
interior of an enum, and the enum is in a mutable location (such as a
local variable or field declared to be mutable), it is possible that
the user will overwrite the enum with a new value of a different
variant, and thus effectively change the type of the memory that the
pointer is pointing at.

The second case has to do with mutability.  Basically, the type
checker has only a limited understanding of mutability.  It will allow
(for example) the user to get an immutable pointer with the address of
a mutable local variable.  It will also allow a `@mut T` or `~mut T`
pointer to be borrowed as a `&r.T` pointer.  These seeming oversights
are in fact intentional; they allow the user to temporarily treat a
mutable value as immutable.  It is up to the borrow check to guarantee
that the value in question is not in fact mutated during the lifetime
`r` of the reference.

# Summary of the safety check

In order to enforce mutability, the borrow check has three tricks up
its sleeve.

First, data which is uniquely tied to the current stack frame (that'll
be defined shortly) is tracked very precisely.  This means that, for
example, if an immutable pointer to a mutable local variable is
created, the borrowck will simply check for assignments to that
particular local variable: no other memory is affected.

Second, if the data is not uniquely tied to the stack frame, it may
still be possible to ensure its validity by rooting garbage collected
pointers at runtime.  For example, if there is a mutable local
variable `x` of type `@T`, and its contents are borrowed with an
expression like `&*x`, then the value of `x` will be rooted (today,
that means its ref count will be temporary increased) for the lifetime
of the reference that is created.  This means that the pointer remains
valid even if `x` is reassigned.

Finally, if neither of these two solutions are applicable, then we
require that all operations within the scope of the reference be
*pure*.  A pure operation is effectively one that does not write to
any aliasable memory.  This means that it is still possible to write
to local variables or other data that is uniquely tied to the stack
frame (there's that term again; formal definition still pending) but
not to data reached via a `&T` or `@T` pointer.  Such writes could
possibly have the side-effect of causing the data which must remain
valid to be overwritten.

# Possible future directions

There are numerous ways that the `borrowck` could be strengthened, but
these are the two most likely:

- flow-sensitivity: we do not currently consider flow at all but only
  block-scoping.  This means that innocent code like the following is
  rejected:

      let mut x: int;
      ...
      x = 5;
      let y: &int = &x; // immutable ptr created
      ...

  The reason is that the scope of the pointer `y` is the entire
  enclosing block, and the assignment `x = 5` occurs within that
  block.  The analysis is not smart enough to see that `x = 5` always
  happens before the immutable pointer is created.  This is relatively
  easy to fix and will surely be fixed at some point.

- finer-grained purity checks: currently, our fallback for
  guaranteeing random references into mutable, aliasable memory is to
  require *total purity*.  This is rather strong.  We could use local
  type-based alias analysis to distinguish writes that could not
  possibly invalid the references which must be guaranteed.  This
  would only work within the function boundaries; function calls would
  still require total purity.  This seems less likely to be
  implemented in the short term as it would make the code
  significantly more complex; there is currently no code to analyze
  the types and determine the possible impacts of a write.

# Terminology

A **loan** is .

# How the code works

The borrow check code is divided into several major modules, each of
which is documented in its own file.

The `gather_loans` and `check_loans` are the two major passes of the
analysis.  The `gather_loans` pass runs over the IR once to determine
what memory must remain valid and for how long.  Its name is a bit of
a misnomer; it does in fact gather up the set of loans which are
granted, but it also determines when @T pointers must be rooted and
for which scopes purity must be required.

The `check_loans` pass walks the IR and examines the loans and purity
requirements computed in `gather_loans`.  It checks to ensure that (a)
the conditions of all loans are honored; (b) no contradictory loans
were granted (for example, loaning out the same memory as mutable and
immutable simultaneously); and (c) any purity requirements are
honored.

The remaining modules are helper modules used by `gather_loans` and
`check_loans`:

- `categorization` has the job of analyzing an expression to determine
  what kind of memory is used in evaluating it (for example, where
  dereferences occur and what kind of pointer is dereferenced; whether
  the memory is mutable; etc)
- `loan` determines when data uniquely tied to the stack frame can be
  loaned out.
- `preserve` determines what actions (if any) must be taken to preserve
  aliasable data.  This is the code which decides when to root
  an @T pointer or to require purity.

# Maps that are created

Borrowck results in two maps.

- `root_map`: identifies those expressions or patterns whose result
  needs to be rooted.  Conceptually the root_map maps from an
  expression or pattern node to a `node_id` identifying the scope for
  which the expression must be rooted (this `node_id` should identify
  a block or call).  The actual key to the map is not an expression id,
  however, but a `root_map_key`, which combines an expression id with a
  deref count and is used to cope with auto-deref.

- `mutbl_map`: identifies those local variables which are modified or
  moved. This is used by trans to guarantee that such variables are
  given a memory location and not used as immediates.
