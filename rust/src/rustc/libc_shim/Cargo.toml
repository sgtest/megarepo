# This is a shim Cargo.toml over the "real Cargo.toml" found in the libc
# repository itself. The purpose for this is to add a build script which prints
# out `--cfg stdbuild` to mirror the makefiles' build system.
#
# Note that other than that this isn't actually needed, and we should probably
# remove this shim in favor of just working with cargo features directly with
# libc. That should make everything nicer!
