// # Cache

/// The projection cache. Unlike the standard caches, this can include
/// infcx-dependent type variables, therefore we have to roll the
/// cache back each time we roll a snapshot back, to avoid assumptions
/// on yet-unresolved inference variables. Types with placeholder
/// regions also have to be removed when the respective snapshot ends.
///
/// Because of that, projection cache entries can be "stranded" and left
/// inaccessible when type variables inside the key are resolved. We make no
/// attempt to recover or remove "stranded" entries, but rather let them be
/// (for the lifetime of the infcx).
///
/// Entries in the projection cache might contain inference variables
/// that will be resolved by obligations on the projection cache entry (e.g.,
/// when a type parameter in the associated type is constrained through
/// an "RFC 447" projection on the impl).
///
/// When working with a fulfillment context, the derived obligations of each
/// projection cache entry will be registered on the fulfillcx, so any users
/// that can wait for a fulfillcx fixed point need not care about this. However,
/// users that don't wait for a fixed point (e.g., trait evaluation) have to
/// resolve the obligations themselves to make sure the projected result is
/// ok and avoid issues like #43132.
///
/// If that is done, after evaluation the obligations, it is a good idea to
/// call `ProjectionCache::complete` to make sure the obligations won't be
/// re-evaluated and avoid an exponential worst-case.
//
// FIXME: we probably also want some sort of cross-infcx cache here to
// reduce the amount of duplication. Let's see what we get with the Chalk reforms.
