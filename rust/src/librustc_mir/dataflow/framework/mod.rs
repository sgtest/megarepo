//! A framework that can express both [gen-kill] and generic dataflow problems.
//!
//! To actually use this framework, you must implement either the `Analysis` or the
//! `GenKillAnalysis` trait. If your transfer function can be expressed with only gen/kill
//! operations, prefer `GenKillAnalysis` since it will run faster while iterating to fixpoint. The
//! `impls` module contains several examples of gen/kill dataflow analyses.
//!
//! Create an `Engine` for your analysis using the `into_engine` method on the `Analysis` trait,
//! then call `iterate_to_fixpoint`. From there, you can use a `ResultsCursor` to inspect the
//! fixpoint solution to your dataflow problem, or implement the `ResultsVisitor` interface and use
//! `visit_results`. The following example uses the `ResultsCursor` approach.
//!
//! ```ignore(cross-crate-imports)
//! use rustc_mir::dataflow::Analysis; // Makes `into_engine` available.
//!
//! fn do_my_analysis(tcx: TyCtxt<'tcx>, body: &mir::Body<'tcx>, did: DefId) {
//!     let analysis = MyAnalysis::new()
//!         .into_engine(tcx, body, did)
//!         .iterate_to_fixpoint()
//!         .into_results_cursor(body);
//!
//!     // Print the dataflow state *after* each statement in the start block.
//!     for (_, statement_index) in body.block_data[START_BLOCK].statements.iter_enumerated() {
//!         cursor.seek_after(Location { block: START_BLOCK, statement_index });
//!         let state = cursor.get();
//!         println!("{:?}", state);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
