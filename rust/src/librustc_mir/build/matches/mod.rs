    /// gives us, for each outcome of the test, a transformed list of
    /// candidates.  For example, if we are testing the current
    /// variant of `x.0`, and we have a candidate `{x.0 @ Some(v), x.1
    /// @ 22}`, then we would have a resulting candidate of `{(x.0 as
    /// Some).0 @ v, x.1 @ 22}`. Note that the first match-pair is now
    /// simpler (and, in fact, irrefutable).
    ///
    /// But there may also be candidates that the test just doesn't
    /// apply to. The classical example involves wildcards:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// # let (x, y, z) = (true, true, true);
    /// match (x, y, z) {
    ///     (true, _, true) => true,    // (0)
    ///     (_, true, _) => true,       // (1)
    ///     (false, false, _) => false, // (2)
    ///     (true, _, false) => false,  // (3)
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// In that case, after we test on `x`, there are 2 overlapping candidate
    /// sets:
    ///
    /// - If the outcome is that `x` is true, candidates 0, 1, and 3
    /// - If the outcome is that `x` is false, candidates 1 and 2
    ///
    /// Here, the traditional "decision tree" method would generate 2
    /// separate code-paths for the 2 separate cases.
    ///
    /// In some cases, this duplication can create an exponential amount of
    /// code. This is most easily seen by noticing that this method terminates
    /// with precisely the reachable arms being reachable - but that problem
    /// is trivially NP-complete:
    ///
    /// ```rust
    ///     match (var0, var1, var2, var3, ..) {
    ///         (true, _, _, false, true, ...) => false,
    ///         (_, true, true, false, _, ...) => false,
    ///         (false, _, false, false, _, ...) => false,
    ///         ...
    ///         _ => true
    ///     }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Here the last arm is reachable only if there is an assignment to
    /// the variables that does not match any of the literals. Therefore,
    /// compilation would take an exponential amount of time in some cases.
    ///
    /// That kind of exponential worst-case might not occur in practice, but
    /// our simplistic treatment of constants and guards would make it occur
    /// in very common situations - for example #29740:
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// match x {
    ///     "foo" if foo_guard => ...,
    ///     "bar" if bar_guard => ...,
    ///     "baz" if baz_guard => ...,
    ///     ...
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Here we first test the match-pair `x @ "foo"`, which is an `Eq` test.
    ///
    /// It might seem that we would end up with 2 disjoint candidate
    /// sets, consisting of the first candidate or the other 3, but our
    /// algorithm doesn't reason about "foo" being distinct from the other
    /// constants; it considers the latter arms to potentially match after
    /// both outcomes, which obviously leads to an exponential amount
    /// of tests.
    ///
    /// To avoid these kinds of problems, our algorithm tries to ensure
    /// the amount of generated tests is linear. When we do a k-way test,
    /// we return an additional "unmatched" set alongside the obvious `k`
    /// sets. When we encounter a candidate that would be present in more
    /// than one of the sets, we put it and all candidates below it into the
    /// "unmatched" set. This ensures these `k+1` sets are disjoint.
    ///
    /// After we perform our test, we branch into the appropriate candidate
    /// set and recurse with `match_candidates`. These sub-matches are
    /// obviously inexhaustive - as we discarded our otherwise set - so
    /// we set their continuation to do `match_candidates` on the
    /// "unmatched" set (which is again inexhaustive).
    ///
    /// If you apply this to the above test, you basically wind up
    /// with an if-else-if chain, testing each candidate in turn,
    /// which is precisely what we want.
    ///
    /// In addition to avoiding exponential-time blowups, this algorithm
    /// also has nice property that each guard and arm is only generated
    /// once.
