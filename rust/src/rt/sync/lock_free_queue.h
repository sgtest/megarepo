/**
 * How and why this lock free queue works:
 *
 * Adapted from the paper titled "Simple, Fast, and Practical Non-Blocking
 * and Blocking Concurrent Queue Algorithms" by Maged M. Michael,
 * Michael L. Scott.
 *
 * Safety Properties:
 *
 * 1. The linked list is always connected.
 * 2. Nodes are only inserted after the last node in the linked list.
 * 3. Nodes are only deleted from the beginning of the linked list.
 * 4. Head always points to the first node in the linked list.
 * 5. Tail always points to a node in the linked list.
 *
 *
 * 1. The linked list is always connected because the next pointer is not set
 *    to null before the node is freed, and no node is freed until deleted
 *    from the linked list.
 *
 * 2. Nodes are only inserted at the end of the linked list because they are
 *    linked through the tail pointer which always points to a node in the
 *    linked list (5) and an inserted node is only linked to a node that has
 *    a null next pointer, and the only such node is the last one (1).
 *
 * 3. Nodes are deleted from the beginning of the list because they are
 *    deleted only when they are pointed to by head which always points to the
 *    first node (4).
 *
 * 4. Head always points to the first node in the list because it only changes
 *    its value to the next node atomically. The new value of head cannot be
 *    null because if there is only one node in the list the dequeue operation
 *    returns without deleting any nodes.
 *
 * 5. Tail always points to a node in the linked list because it never lags
 *    behind head, so it can never point to a deleted node. Also, when tail
 *    changes its value it always swings to the next node in the list and it
 *    never tires to change its value if the next pointer is NULL.
