	__morestack

	This function implements stack growth using the mechanism
	devised by Ian Lance Taylor for gccgo, described here:

	http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SplitStacks

	The Rust stack is composed of a linked list of stack segments,
	and each stack segment contains two parts: the work area,
	where Rust functions are allowed to execute; and the red zone,
	where no Rust code can execute, but where short runtime
	functions (including __morestack), the dynamic linker, signal
	handlers, and the unwinder can run.

	Each Rust function contains an LLVM-generated prologue that
	compares the stack space required for the current function to
	the space remaining in the current stack segment,
	maintained in a platform-specific TLS slot.  The stack limit
	is strategically maintained by the Rust runtime so that it is
	always in place whenever a Rust function is running.

	When there is not enough room to run the function, the function
	prologue makes a call to __morestack to allocate a new stack
	segment, copy any stack-based arguments to it, switch stacks,
	then resume execution of the original function.

	-- The __morestack calling convention --

	For reasons of efficiency the __morestack calling convention
	is bizarre. The calling function does not attempt to align the
	stack for the call, and on x86_64 the arguments to __morestack
	are passed in scratch registers in order to preserve the
	original function's arguments.

	Once __morestack has switched to the new stack, instead of
	returning, it then calls into the original function, resuming
	execution at the instruction following the call to
	__morestack. Thus, when the original function returns it
	actually returns to __morestack, which then deallocates the
	stack and returns again to the original function's caller.

	-- Unwinding --

	All this trickery causes hell when it comes time for the
	unwinder to navigate it's way through this function. What
	will happen is the original function will be unwound first
	without any special effort, then the unwinder encounters
	the __morestack frame, which is sitting just above a
	tiny fraction of a frame (containing just a return pointer
	and, on 32-bit, the arguments to __morestack).

	We deal with this by claiming that little bit of stack
	is actually part of the __morestack frame, encoded as
	DWARF call frame instructions (CFI) by .cfi assembler
	pseudo-ops.

	One final complication (that took me a week to figure out)
	is that OS X 10.6+ uses its own 'compact unwind info',
	an undocumented format generated by the linker from
	the DWARF CFI. This compact unwind info doesn't correctly
	capture the nuance of the __morestack frame, and as a
	result all of our linking on OS X uses the -no_compact_unwind
	flag.
