//! Rust's core allocation library
//!
//! This is the lowest level library through which allocation in Rust can be
//! performed where the allocation is assumed to succeed. This library will
//! trigger a task failure when allocation fails.
//!
//! This library, like libcore, is not intended for general usage, but rather as
//! a building block of other libraries. The types and interfaces in this
//! library are reexported through the [standard library](../std/index.html),
//! and should not be used through this library.
//!
//! Currently, there are four major definitions in this library.
//!
//! ## Owned pointers
//!
//! The [`Box`](owned/index.html) type is the core owned pointer type in rust.
//! There can only be one owner of a `Box`, and the owner can decide to mutate
//! the contents.
//!
//! This type can be sent among tasks efficiently as the size of a `Box` value
//! is just a pointer. Tree-like data structures are often built on owned
//! pointers because each node often has only one owner, the parent.
//!
//! ## Reference counted pointers
//!
//! The [`Rc`](rc/index.html) type is a non-threadsafe reference-counted pointer
//! type intended for sharing memory within a task. An `Rc` pointer wraps a
//! type, `T`, and only allows access to `&T`, a shared reference.
//!
//! This type is useful when inherited mutability is too constraining for an
//! application (such as using `Box`), and is often paired with the `Cell` or
//! `RefCell` types in order to allow mutation.
//!
//! ## Atomically reference counted pointers
//!
//! The [`Arc`](arc/index.html) type is the threadsafe equivalent of the `Rc`
//! type. It provides all the same functionality of `Rc`, except it requires
//! that the contained type `T` is shareable. Additionally, `Arc<T>` is itself
//! sendable while `Rc<T>` is not.
//!
//! This types allows for shared access to the contained data, and is often
//! paired with synchronization primitives such as mutexes to allow mutation of
//! shared resources.
//!
//! ## Heap interfaces
//!
//! The [`heap`](heap/index.html) and [`libc_heap`](libc_heap/index.html)
//! modules are the unsafe interfaces to the underlying allocation systems. The
//! `heap` module is considered the default heap, and is not necessarily backed
//! by libc malloc/free.  The `libc_heap` module is defined to be wired up to
//! the system malloc/free.

    //                allocate.
    unsafe { core::intrinsics::abort() }
}

// FIXME(#14344): When linking liballoc with libstd, this library will be linked
//                as an rlib (it only exists as an rlib). It turns out that an
//                optimized standard library doesn't actually use *any* symbols
//                from this library. Everything is inlined and optimized away.
//                This means that linkers will actually omit the object for this
//                file, even though it may be needed in the future.
//
//                To get around this for now, we define a dummy symbol which
//                will never get inlined so the stdlib can call it. The stdlib's
//                reference to this symbol will cause this library's object file
//                to get linked in to libstd successfully (the linker won't
//                optimize it out).
