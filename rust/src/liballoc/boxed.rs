//! A pointer type for heap allocation.
//!
//! `Box<T>`, casually referred to as a 'box', provides the simplest form of
//! heap allocation in Rust. Boxes provide ownership for this allocation, and
//! drop their contents when they go out of scope.
//!
//! Boxes are useful in two situations: recursive data structures, and
//! occasionally when returning data. [The Pointer chapter of the
//! Book](../../../book/pointers.html#best-practices-1) explains these cases in
//! detail.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Creating a box:
//!
//! ```
//! let x = Box::new(5);
//! ```
//!
//! Creating a recursive data structure:
//!
//! ```
//! #[derive(Debug)]
//! enum List<T> {
//!     Cons(T, Box<List<T>>),
//!     Nil,
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let list: List<i32> = List::Cons(1, Box::new(List::Cons(2, Box::new(List::Nil))));
//!     println!("{:?}", list);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This will print `Cons(1, Box(Cons(2, Box(Nil))))`.
