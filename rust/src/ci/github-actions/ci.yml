#   WARNING! Action needed when changing this file   #
######################################################

# Due to GitHub Actions limitations, we can't use YAML Anchors directly in the
# CI configuration stored on the repository. To work around that this file is
# expanded by a tool in the repository, and the expansion is committed as well.
#
# After you make any change to the file you'll need to run this command:
#
#   ./x.py run src/tools/expand-yaml-anchors
#
# ...and commit the file it updated in addition to this one. If you forget this
# step CI will fail.

###############################
#   YAML Anchors Definition   #
###############################

# This key contains most of the YAML anchors that will be used later in the
# document. YAML anchors allows us to greatly reduce duplication inside the CI
# configuration by reusing parts of the configuration.
#
# YAML anchors work by defining an anchor with `&anchor-name` and reusing its
# content in another place with `*anchor-name`. The special `<<` map key merges
# the content of the map with the content of the anchor (or list of anchors).
#
# The expand-yaml-anchors tool will automatically remove this block from the
# output YAML file.
