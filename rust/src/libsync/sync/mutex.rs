//! A proper mutex implementation regardless of the "flavor of task" which is
//! acquiring the lock.

// # Implementation of Rust mutexes
//
// Most answers to the question of "how do I use a mutex" are "use pthreads",
// but for Rust this isn't quite sufficient. Green threads cannot acquire an OS
// mutex because they can context switch among many OS threads, leading to
// deadlocks with other green threads.
//
// Another problem for green threads grabbing an OS mutex is that POSIX dictates
// that unlocking a mutex on a different thread from where it was locked is
// undefined behavior. Remember that green threads can migrate among OS threads,
// so this would mean that we would have to pin green threads to OS threads,
// which is less than ideal.
//
// ## Using deschedule/reawaken
//
// We already have primitives for descheduling/reawakening tasks, so they're the
// first obvious choice when implementing a mutex. The idea would be to have a
// concurrent queue that everyone is pushed on to, and then the owner of the
// mutex is the one popping from the queue.
//
// Unfortunately, this is not very performant for native tasks. The suspected
// reason for this is that each native thread is suspended on its own condition
// variable, unique from all the other threads. In this situation, the kernel
// has no idea what the scheduling semantics are of the user program, so all of
// the threads are distributed among all cores on the system. This ends up
// having very expensive wakeups of remote cores high up in the profile when
// handing off the mutex among native tasks. On the other hand, when using an OS
// mutex, the kernel knows that all native threads are contended on the same
// mutex, so they're in theory all migrated to a single core (fast context
// switching).
//
// ## Mixing implementations
//
// From that above information, we have two constraints. The first is that
// green threads can't touch os mutexes, and the second is that native tasks
// pretty much *must* touch an os mutex.
//
// As a compromise, the queueing implementation is used for green threads and
// the os mutex is used for native threads (why not have both?). This ends up
// leading to fairly decent performance for both native threads and green
// threads on various workloads (uncontended and contended).
//
// The crux of this implementation is an atomic work which is CAS'd on many many
// times in order to manage a few flags about who's blocking where and whether
// it's locked or not.
