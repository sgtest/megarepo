//! Interface to random number generators in Rust.
//!
//! This is an experimental library which lives underneath the standard library
//! in its dependency chain. This library is intended to define the interface
//! for random number generation and also provide utilities around doing so. It
//! is not recommended to use this library directly, but rather the official
//! interface through `std::rand`.

// Do not remove on snapshot creation. Needed for bootstrap. (Issue #22364)
