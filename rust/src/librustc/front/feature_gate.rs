//! Feature gating

//! This modules implements the gating necessary for preventing certain compiler
//! features from being used by default. This module will crawl a pre-expanded
//! AST to ensure that there are no features which are used that are not
//! enabled.
//!
//! Features are enabled in programs via the crate-level attributes of
//! #[feature(...)] with a comma-separated list of features.
