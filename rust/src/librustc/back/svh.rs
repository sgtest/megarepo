//! Calculation and management of a Strict Version Hash for crates
//!
//! # Today's ABI problem
//!
//! In today's implementation of rustc, it is incredibly difficult to achieve
//! forward binary compatibility without resorting to C-like interfaces. Within
//! rust code itself, abi details such as symbol names suffer from a variety of
//! unrelated factors to code changing such as the "def id drift" problem. This
//! ends up yielding confusing error messages about metadata mismatches and
//! such.
//!
//! The core of this problem is when an upstream dependency changes and
//! downstream dependants are not recompiled. This causes compile errors because
//! the upstream crate's metadata has changed but the downstream crates are
//! still referencing the older crate's metadata.
//!
//! This problem exists for many reasons, the primary of which is that rust does
//! not currently support forwards ABI compatibility (in place upgrades of a
//! crate).
//!
//! # SVH and how it alleviates the problem
//!
//! With all of this knowledge on hand, this module contains the implementation
//! of a notion of a "Strict Version Hash" for a crate. This is essentially a
//! hash of all contents of a crate which can somehow be exposed to downstream
//! crates.
//!
//! This hash is currently calculated by just hashing the AST, but this is
//! obviously wrong (doc changes should not result in an incompatible ABI).
//! Implementation-wise, this is required at this moment in time.
//!
//! By encoding this strict version hash into all crate's metadata, stale crates
//! can be detected immediately and error'd about by rustc itself.
//!
//! # Relevant links
//!
//! Original issue: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/10207

        //        crate.  Fixing this would require more in-depth analysis in
        //        this function about what portions of the crate are reachable
        //        in tandem with bug fixes throughout the rest of the compiler.
        //
        //        Note that for now we actually exclude some top-level things
        //        from the crate like the CrateConfig/span. The CrateConfig
        //        contains command-line `--cfg` flags, so this means that the
        //        stage1/stage2 AST for libstd and such is different hash-wise
        //        when it's actually the exact same representation-wise.
        //
        //        As a first stab at only hashing the relevant parts of the
        //        AST, this only hashes the module/attrs, not the CrateConfig
        //        field.

        //        avoid collisions.
