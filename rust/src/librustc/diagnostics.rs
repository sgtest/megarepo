E0001: r##"
This error suggests that the expression arm corresponding to the noted pattern
will never be reached as for all possible values of the expression being
matched, one of the preceding patterns will match.

This means that perhaps some of the preceding patterns are too general, this one
is too specific or the ordering is incorrect.
"##,

E0002: r##"
This error indicates that an empty match expression is illegal because the type
it is matching on is non-empty (there exist values of this type). In safe code
it is impossible to create an instance of an empty type, so empty match
expressions are almost never desired.  This error is typically fixed by adding
one or more cases to the match expression.

An example of an empty type is `enum Empty { }`.
"##,

E0003: r##"
Not-a-Number (NaN) values cannot be compared for equality and hence can never
match the input to a match expression. To match against NaN values, you should
instead use the `is_nan` method in a guard, as in: x if x.is_nan() => ...
"##,

E0004: r##"
This error indicates that the compiler cannot guarantee a matching pattern for
one or more possible inputs to a match expression. Guaranteed matches are
required in order to assign values to match expressions, or alternatively,
determine the flow of execution.

If you encounter this error you must alter your patterns so that every possible
value of the input type is matched. For types with a small number of variants
(like enums) you should probably cover all cases explicitly. Alternatively, the
underscore `_` wildcard pattern can be added after all other patterns to match
"anything else".

Patterns used to bind names must be irrefutable, that is, they must guarantee
that a name will be extracted in all cases. If you encounter this error you
probably need to use a `match` or `if let` to deal with the possibility of
failure.

E0007: r##"
This error indicates that the bindings in a match arm would require a value to
be moved into more than one location, thus violating unique ownership. Code like
the following is invalid as it requires the entire Option<String> to be moved
into a variable called `op_string` while simultaneously requiring the inner
String to be moved into a variable called `s`.

let x = Some("s".to_string());
match x {
    op_string @ Some(s) => ...
    None => ...
}

E0008: r##"
Names bound in match arms retain their type in pattern guards. As such, if a
name is bound by move in a pattern, it should also be moved to wherever it is
referenced in the pattern guard code. Doing so however would prevent the name
from being available in the body of the match arm. Consider the following:

match Some("hi".to_string()) {
    Some(s) if s.len() == 0 => // use s.
    ...
}

The variable `s` has type String, and its use in the guard is as a variable of
type String. The guard code effectively executes in a separate scope to the body
of the arm, so the value would be moved into this anonymous scope and therefore
become unavailable in the body of the arm. Although this example seems
innocuous, the problem is most clear when considering functions that take their
argument by value.

match Some("hi".to_string()) {
    Some(s) if { drop(s); false } => (),
    Some(s) => // use s.
    ...
}

The value would be dropped in the guard then become unavailable not only in the
body of that arm but also in all subsequent arms! The solution is to bind by
reference when using guards or refactor the entire expression, perhaps by
putting the condition inside the body of the arm.
"##,

E0009: r##"
In a pattern, all values that don't implement the `Copy` trait have to be bound
the same way. The goal here is to avoid binding simultaneously by-move and
by-ref.

This limitation may be removed in a future version of Rust.

Wrong example:

```
struct X { x: (), }

let x = Some((X { x: () }, X { x: () }));
match x {
    Some((y, ref z)) => {},
    None => panic!()
}
```

You have two solutions:
1. Bind the pattern's values the same way:

```
struct X { x: (), }

let x = Some((X { x: () }, X { x: () }));
match x {
    Some((ref y, ref z)) => {},
    // or Some((y, z)) => {}
    None => panic!()
}
```

2. Implement the `Copy` trait for the X structure (however, please
keep in mind that the first solution should be preferred!):

```
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct X { x: (), }

let x = Some((X { x: () }, X { x: () }));
match x {
    Some((y, ref z)) => {},
    None => panic!()
}
```

The only function calls allowed in static or constant expressions are enum
variant constructors or struct constructors (for unit or tuple structs). This
is because Rust currently does not support compile-time function execution.
"##,

E0018: r##"
The value of static and const variables must be known at compile time. You
can't cast a pointer as an integer because we can't know what value the
address will take.

However, pointers to other constants' addresses are allowed in constants,
example:

```
const X: u32 = 50;
const Y: *const u32 = &X;
```

Therefore, casting one of these non-constant pointers to an integer results
in a non-constant integer which lead to this error. Example:

```
const X: u32 = 50;
const Y: *const u32 = &X;
println!("{:?}", Y);
```

This error indicates that an attempt was made to divide by zero (or take the
remainder of a zero divisor) in a static or constant expression.
"##,

E0133: r##"
Using unsafe functionality, such as dereferencing raw pointers and calling
functions via FFI or marked as unsafe, is potentially dangerous and disallowed
by safety checks. As such, those safety checks can be temporarily relaxed by
wrapping the unsafe instructions inside an `unsafe` block. For instance:

unsafe fn f() { return; }

fn main() {
    unsafe { f(); }
}

Lang items are already implemented in the standard library. Unless you are
writing a free-standing application (e.g. a kernel), you do not need to provide
them yourself.

You can build a free-standing crate by adding `#![no_std]` to the crate
attributes:

#![feature(no_std)]
#![no_std]

"##,

E0158: r##"
`const` and `static` mean different things. A `const` is a compile-time
constant, an alias for a literal value. This property means you can match it
directly within a pattern.

The `static` keyword, on the other hand, guarantees a fixed location in memory.
This does not always mean that the value is constant. For example, a global
mutex can be declared `static` as well.

If you want to match against a `static`, consider using a guard instead:

static FORTY_TWO: i32 = 42;
match Some(42) {
    Some(x) if x == FORTY_TWO => ...
    ...
}
"##,

E0161: r##"
In Rust, you can only move a value when its size is known at compile time.

To work around this restriction, consider "hiding" the value behind a reference:
either `&x` or `&mut x`. Since a reference has a fixed size, this lets you move
it around as usual.
"##,

E0162: r##"
An if-let pattern attempts to match the pattern, and enters the body if the
match was succesful. If the match is irrefutable (when it cannot fail to match),
use a regular `let`-binding instead. For instance:

struct Irrefutable(i32);
let irr = Irrefutable(0);

// This fails to compile because the match is irrefutable.
if let Irrefutable(x) = irr {
    // This body will always be executed.
    foo(x);
}

// Try this instead:
let Irrefutable(x) = irr;
foo(x);
"##,

E0165: r##"
A while-let pattern attempts to match the pattern, and enters the body if the
match was succesful. If the match is irrefutable (when it cannot fail to match),
use a regular `let`-binding inside a `loop` instead. For instance:

struct Irrefutable(i32);
let irr = Irrefutable(0);

// This fails to compile because the match is irrefutable.
while let Irrefutable(x) = irr {
    ...
}

// Try this instead:
loop {
    let Irrefutable(x) = irr;
    ...
}
"##,

E0170: r##"
Enum variants are qualified by default. For example, given this type:

enum Method {
    GET,
    POST
}

you would match it using:

match m {
    Method::GET => ...
    Method::POST => ...
}

If you don't qualify the names, the code will bind new variables named "GET" and
"POST" instead. This behavior is likely not what you want, so rustc warns when
that happens.

Qualified names are good practice, and most code works well with them. But if
you prefer them unqualified, you can import the variants into scope:

use Method::*;
enum Method { GET, POST }

This error indicates the use of loop keyword (break or continue) inside a
closure but outside of any loop. Break and continue can be used as normal
inside closures as long as they are also contained within a loop. To halt the
execution of a closure you should instead use a return statement.

Patterns used to bind names must be irrefutable. That is, they must guarantee
that a name will be extracted in all cases. Instead of pattern matching the
loop variable, consider using a `match` or `if let` inside the loop body. For
instance:

// This fails because `None` is not covered.
for Some(x) in xs {
    ...
}

// Match inside the loop instead:
for item in xs {
    match item {
        Some(x) => ...
        None => ...
    }
}

// Or use `if let`:
for item in xs {
    if let Some(x) = item {
        ...
    }
}

E0301: r##"
Mutable borrows are not allowed in pattern guards, because matching cannot have
side effects. Side effects could alter the matched object or the environment
on which the match depends in such a way, that the match would not be
exhaustive. For instance, the following would not match any arm if mutable
borrows were allowed:

match Some(()) {
    None => { },
    option if option.take().is_none() => { /* impossible, option is `Some` */ },
    Some(_) => { } // When the previous match failed, the option became `None`.
}
"##,

E0302: r##"
Assignments are not allowed in pattern guards, because matching cannot have
side effects. Side effects could alter the matched object or the environment
on which the match depends in such a way, that the match would not be
exhaustive. For instance, the following would not match any arm if assignments
were allowed:

match Some(()) {
    None => { },
    option if { option = None; false } { },
    Some(_) => { } // When the previous match failed, the option became `None`.
}
"##,

E0303: r##"
In certain cases it is possible for sub-bindings to violate memory safety.
Updates to the borrow checker in a future version of Rust may remove this
restriction, but for now patterns must be rewritten without sub-bindings.

// Before.
match Some("hi".to_string()) {
    ref op_string_ref @ Some(ref s) => ...
    None => ...
}

// After.
match Some("hi".to_string()) {
    Some(ref s) => {
        let op_string_ref = &Some(&s);
        ...
    }
    None => ...
}

The `op_string_ref` binding has type &Option<&String> in both cases.
