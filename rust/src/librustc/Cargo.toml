# Note that these dependencies are a lie, they're just here to get linkage to
# work.
#
# We're creating a bunch of dylibs for the compiler but we're also compiling a
# bunch of crates.io crates. Everything in the compiler is compiled as an
# rlib/dylib pair but all crates.io crates tend to just be rlibs. This means
# we've got a problem for dependency graphs that look like:
#
#           foo - rustc_trans
#         /                  \
#   rustc                     ---- rustc_driver
#         \                     /
#           foo - rustc_metadata
#
# Here the crate `foo` is linked into the `rustc_trans` and the
# `rustc_metadata` dylibs, meaning we've got duplicate copies! When we then
# go to link `rustc_driver` the compiler notices this and gives us a compiler
# error.
#
# To work around this problem we just add these crates.io dependencies to the
# `rustc` crate which is a shared dependency above. That way the crate `foo`
# shows up in the dylib for the `rustc` crate, deduplicating it and allowing
# crates like `rustc_trans` to use `foo` *through* the `rustc` crate.
#
# tl;dr; this is not needed to get `rustc` to compile, but if you remove it then
#        later crate stop compiling. If you can remove this and everything
#        compiles, then please feel free to do so!
