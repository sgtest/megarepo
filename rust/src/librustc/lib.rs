//! The "main crate" of the Rust compiler. This crate contains common
//! type definitions that are used by the other crates in the rustc
//! "family". Some prominent examples (note that each of these modules
//! has their own README with further details).
//!
//! - **HIR.** The "high-level (H) intermediate representation (IR)" is
//!   defined in the `hir` module.
//! - **MIR.** The "mid-level (M) intermediate representation (IR)" is
//!   defined in the `mir` module. This module contains only the
//!   *definition* of the MIR; the passes that transform and operate
//!   on MIR are found in `librustc_mir` crate.
//! - **Types.** The internal representation of types used in rustc is
//!   defined in the `ty` module. This includes the **type context**
//!   (or `tcx`), which is the central context during most of
//!   compilation, containing the interners and other things.
//! - **Traits.** Trait resolution is implemented in the `traits` module.
//! - **Type inference.** The type inference code can be found in the `infer` module;
//!   this code handles low-level equality and subtyping operations. The
//!   type check pass in the compiler is found in the `librustc_typeck` crate.
//!
//! For more information about how rustc works, see the [rustc guide].
