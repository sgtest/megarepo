E0154: r##"
Imports (`use` statements) are not allowed after non-item statements, such as
variable declarations and expression statements.

Here is an example that demonstrates the error:

```
fn f() {
    // Variable declaration before import
    let x = 0;
    use std::io::Read;
    ...
}
```

The solution is to declare the imports at the top of the block, function, or
file.

Here is the previous example again, with the correct order:

```
fn f() {
    use std::io::Read;
    let x = 0;
    ...
}
```

See the Declaration Statements section of the reference for more information
about what constitutes an Item declaration and what does not:

"##,

E0259: r##"
The name chosen for an external crate conflicts with another external crate that
has been imported into the current module.

Wrong example:

```
extern crate a;
extern crate crate_a as a;
```

The solution is to choose a different name that doesn't conflict with any
external crate imported into the current module.

Correct example:

```
extern crate a;
extern crate crate_a as other_name;
```
"##,

E0260: r##"
The name for an item declaration conflicts with an external crate's name.

For instance,

```
extern crate abc;

struct abc;
```

There are two possible solutions:

Solution #1: Rename the item.

```
extern crate abc;

struct xyz;
```

Solution #2: Import the crate with a different name.

```
extern crate abc as xyz;

struct abc;
```

User-defined types or type parameters cannot shadow the primitive types.
This error indicates you tried to define a type, struct or enum with the same
name as an existing primitive type.

See the Types section of the reference for more information about the primitive
types:
