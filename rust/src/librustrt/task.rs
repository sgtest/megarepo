/// State associated with Rust tasks.
///
/// Rust tasks are primarily built with two separate components. One is this
/// structure which handles standard services such as TLD, unwinding support,
/// naming of a task, etc. The second component is the runtime of this task, a
/// `Runtime` trait object.
///
/// The `Runtime` object instructs this task how it can perform critical
/// operations such as blocking, rescheduling, I/O constructors, etc. The two
/// halves are separately owned, but one is often found contained in the other.
/// A task's runtime can be reflected upon with the `maybe_take_runtime` method,
/// and otherwise its ownership is managed with `take_runtime` and
/// `put_runtime`.
///
/// In general, this structure should not be used. This is meant to be an
/// unstable internal detail of the runtime itself. From time-to-time, however,
/// it is useful to manage tasks directly. An example of this would be
/// interoperating with the Rust runtime from FFI callbacks or such. For this
/// reason, there are two methods of note with the `Task` structure.
///
/// * `run` - This function will execute a closure inside the context of a task.
///           Failure is caught and handled via the task's on_exit callback. If
///           this fails, the task is still returned, but it can no longer be
///           used, it is poisoned.
///
/// * `destroy` - This is a required function to call to destroy a task. If a
///               task falls out of scope without calling `destroy`, its
///               destructor bomb will go off, aborting the process.
///
/// With these two methods, tasks can be re-used to execute code inside of its
/// context while having a point in the future where destruction is allowed.
/// More information can be found on these specific methods.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```no_run
/// extern crate native;
/// use std::uint;
/// # fn main() {
///
/// // Create a task using a native runtime
/// let task = native::task::new((0, uint::MAX));
///
/// // Run some code, catching any possible failures
/// let task = task.run(|| {
///     // Run some code inside this task
///     println!("Hello with a native runtime!");
/// });
///
/// // Run some code again, catching the failure
/// let task = task.run(|| {
///     fail!("oh no, what to do!");
/// });
///
/// // Now that the task is failed, it can never be used again
/// assert!(task.is_destroyed());
///
/// // Deallocate the resources associated with this task
/// task.destroy();
/// # }

        //    abort the runtime #14807.

        //    allocation from the wrong heap (because the current one has been
        //    replaced).
        //
