E0178: r##"
In types, the `+` type operator has low precedence, so it is often necessary
to use parentheses.

For example:

```compile_fail,E0178
trait Foo {}

struct Bar<'a> {
    w: &'a Foo + Copy,   // error, use &'a (Foo + Copy)
    x: &'a Foo + 'a,     // error, use &'a (Foo + 'a)
    y: &'a mut Foo + 'a, // error, use &'a mut (Foo + 'a)
    z: fn() -> Foo + 'a, // error, use fn() -> (Foo + 'a)
}
```

More details can be found in [RFC 438].

"##,

E0536: r##"
The `not` cfg-predicate was malformed.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0536
#[cfg(not())] // error: expected 1 cfg-pattern
pub fn something() {}

pub fn main() {}
```

The `not` predicate expects one cfg-pattern. Example:

```
#[cfg(not(target_os = "linux"))] // ok!
pub fn something() {}

pub fn main() {}
```

For more information about the cfg attribute, read:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html#conditional-compilation
"##,

E0537: r##"
An unknown predicate was used inside the `cfg` attribute.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0537
#[cfg(unknown())] // error: invalid predicate `unknown`
pub fn something() {}

pub fn main() {}
```

The `cfg` attribute supports only three kinds of predicates:

 * any
 * all
 * not

Example:

```
#[cfg(not(target_os = "linux"))] // ok!
pub fn something() {}

pub fn main() {}
```

For more information about the cfg attribute, read:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html#conditional-compilation
"##,

E0552: r##"
A unrecognized representation attribute was used.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0552
#[repr(D)] // error: unrecognized representation hint
struct MyStruct {
    my_field: usize
}
```

You can use a `repr` attribute to tell the compiler how you want a struct or
enum to be laid out in memory.

Make sure you're using one of the supported options:

```
#[repr(C)] // ok!
struct MyStruct {
    my_field: usize
}
```

For more information about specifying representations, see the ["Alternative
Representations" section] of the Rustonomicon.

"##,

E0554: r##"
Feature attributes are only allowed on the nightly release channel. Stable or
beta compilers will not comply.

Example of erroneous code (on a stable compiler):

```ignore (depends on release channel)
#![feature(non_ascii_idents)] // error: #![feature] may not be used on the
                              //        stable release channel
```

If you need the feature, make sure to use a nightly release of the compiler
(but be warned that the feature may be removed or altered in the future).
"##,

E0557: r##"
A feature attribute named a feature that has been removed.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0557
#![feature(managed_boxes)] // error: feature has been removed
```

Delete the offending feature attribute.
"##,

E0565: r##"
A literal was used in an attribute that doesn't support literals.

Erroneous code example:

```ignore (compile_fail not working here; see Issue #43707)
#![feature(attr_literals)]

#[inline("always")] // error: unsupported literal
pub fn something() {}
```

Literals in attributes are new and largely unsupported. Work to support literals
where appropriate is ongoing. Try using an unquoted name instead:

```
#[inline(always)]
pub fn something() {}
```
"##,

E0583: r##"
A file wasn't found for an out-of-line module.

Erroneous code example:

```ignore (compile_fail not working here; see Issue #43707)
mod file_that_doesnt_exist; // error: file not found for module

fn main() {}
```

Please be sure that a file corresponding to the module exists. If you
want to use a module named `file_that_doesnt_exist`, you need to have a file
named `file_that_doesnt_exist.rs` or `file_that_doesnt_exist/mod.rs` in the
same directory.
"##,

E0585: r##"
A documentation comment that doesn't document anything was found.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0585
fn main() {
    // The following doc comment will fail:
    /// This is a useless doc comment!
}
```

Documentation comments need to be followed by items, including functions,
types, modules, etc. Examples:

```
/// I'm documenting the following struct:
struct Foo;

/// I'm documenting the following function:
fn foo() {}
```
"##,

E0586: r##"
An inclusive range was used with no end.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0586
#![feature(inclusive_range_syntax)]

fn main() {
    let tmp = vec![0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1];
    let x = &tmp[1..=]; // error: inclusive range was used with no end
}
```

An inclusive range needs an end in order to *include* it. If you just need a
start and no end, use a non-inclusive range (with `..`):

```
fn main() {
    let tmp = vec![0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1];
    let x = &tmp[1..]; // ok!
}
```

Or put an end to your inclusive range:

```
#![feature(inclusive_range_syntax)]

fn main() {
    let tmp = vec![0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1];
    let x = &tmp[1..=3]; // ok!
}
```
"##,

E0658: r##"
An unstable feature was used.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E658
let x = ::std::u128::MAX; // error: use of unstable library feature 'i128'
```

If you're using a stable or a beta version of rustc, you won't be able to use
any unstable features. In order to do so, please switch to a nightly version of
rustc (by using rustup).

If you're using a nightly version of rustc, just add the corresponding feature
to be able to use it:

```
#![feature(i128)]

fn main() {
    let x = ::std::u128::MAX; // ok!
}
```
"##,

E0633: r##"
The `unwind` attribute was malformed.

Erroneous code example:

```ignore (compile_fail not working here; see Issue #43707)
#[unwind()] // error: expected one argument
pub extern fn something() {}

fn main() {}
```

The `#[unwind]` attribute should be used as follows:

- `#[unwind(aborts)]` -- specifies that if a non-Rust ABI function
  should abort the process if it attempts to unwind. This is the safer
  and preferred option.

- `#[unwind(allowed)]` -- specifies that a non-Rust ABI function
  should be allowed to unwind. This can easily result in Undefined
  Behavior (UB), so be careful.

NB. The default behavior here is "allowed", but this is unspecified
and likely to change in the future.
