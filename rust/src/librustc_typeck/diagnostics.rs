E0046: r##"
When trying to make some type implement a trait `Foo`, you must, at minimum,
provide implementations for all of `Foo`'s required methods (meaning the
methods that do not have default implementations), as well as any required
trait items like associated types or constants.
"##,

E0054: r##"
It is not allowed to cast to a bool. If you are trying to cast a numeric type
to a bool, you can compare it with zero instead:

```
let x = 5;

// Ok
let x_is_nonzero = x != 0;

// Not allowed, won't compile
let x_is_nonzero = x as bool;
```
"##,

E0062: r##"
This error indicates that during an attempt to build a struct or struct-like
enum variant, one of the fields was specified more than once. Each field should
be specified exactly one time.
"##,

E0063: r##"
This error indicates that during an attempt to build a struct or struct-like
enum variant, one of the fields was not provided. Each field should be specified
exactly once.
"##,

E0067: r##"
The left-hand side of an assignment operator must be an lvalue expression. An
lvalue expression represents a memory location and includes item paths (ie,
namespaced variables), dereferences, indexing expressions, and field references.

```
use std::collections::LinkedList;

// Good
let mut list = LinkedList::new();


// Bad: assignment to non-lvalue expression
LinkedList::new() += 1;
```
"##,

E0081: r##"
Enum discriminants are used to differentiate enum variants stored in memory.
This error indicates that the same value was used for two or more variants,
making them impossible to tell apart.

```
// Good.
enum Enum {
    P,
    X = 3,
    Y = 5
}

// Bad.
enum Enum {
    P = 3,
    X = 3,
    Y = 5
}
```

Note that variants without a manually specified discriminant are numbered from
top to bottom starting from 0, so clashes can occur with seemingly unrelated
variants.

```
enum Bad {
    X,
    Y = 0
}
```

Here `X` will have already been assigned the discriminant 0 by the time `Y` is
encountered, so a conflict occurs.
"##,

E0082: r##"
The default type for enum discriminants is `isize`, but it can be adjusted by
adding the `repr` attribute to the enum declaration. This error indicates that
an integer literal given as a discriminant is not a member of the discriminant
type. For example:

```
#[repr(u8)]
enum Thing {
    A = 1024,
    B = 5
}
```

Here, 1024 lies outside the valid range for `u8`, so the discriminant for `A` is
invalid. You may want to change representation types to fix this, or else change
invalid discriminant values so that they fit within the existing type.

Note also that without a representation manually defined, the compiler will
optimize by using the smallest integer type possible.
"##,

E0083: r##"
At present, it's not possible to define a custom representation for an enum with
a single variant. As a workaround you can add a `Dummy` variant.

See: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10292
"##,

E0084: r##"
It is impossible to define an integer type to be used to represent zero-variant
enum values because there are no zero-variant enum values. There is no way to
construct an instance of the following type using only safe code:

```
enum Empty {}
```
"##,

E0131: r##"
It is not possible to define `main` with type parameters, or even with function
parameters. When `main` is present, it must take no arguments and return `()`.
"##,

E0132: r##"
It is not possible to declare type parameters on a function that has the `start`
attribute. Such a function must have the following type signature:

```
fn(isize, *const *const u8) -> isize
```
"##,

E0184: r##"
Explicitly implementing both Drop and Copy for a type is currently disallowed.
This feature can make some sense in theory, but the current implementation is
incorrect and can lead to memory unsafety (see [issue #20126][iss20126]), so
it has been disabled for now.

"##,

E0204: r##"
An attempt to implement the `Copy` trait for a struct failed because one of the
fields does not implement `Copy`. To fix this, you must implement `Copy` for the
mentioned field. Note that this may not be possible, as in the example of

```
struct Foo {
    foo : Vec<u32>,
}

impl Copy for Foo { }
```

This fails because `Vec<T>` does not implement `Copy` for any `T`.

Here's another example that will fail:

```
#[derive(Copy)]
struct Foo<'a> {
    ty: &'a mut bool,
}
```

This fails because `&mut T` is not `Copy`, even when `T` is `Copy` (this
differs from the behavior for `&T`, which is always `Copy`).
"##,

E0205: r##"
An attempt to implement the `Copy` trait for an enum failed because one of the
variants does not implement `Copy`. To fix this, you must implement `Copy` for
the mentioned variant. Note that this may not be possible, as in the example of

```
enum Foo {
    Bar(Vec<u32>),
    Baz,
}

impl Copy for Foo { }
```

This fails because `Vec<T>` does not implement `Copy` for any `T`.

Here's another example that will fail:

```
#[derive(Copy)]
enum Foo<'a> {
    Bar(&'a mut bool),
    Baz
}
```

This fails because `&mut T` is not `Copy`, even when `T` is `Copy` (this
differs from the behavior for `&T`, which is always `Copy`).
"##,

E0206: r##"
You can only implement `Copy` for a struct or enum. Both of the following
examples will fail, because neither `i32` (primitive type) nor `&'static Bar`
(reference to `Bar`) is a struct or enum:

```
type Foo = i32;
impl Copy for Foo { } // error

#[derive(Copy, Clone)]
struct Bar;
impl Copy for &'static Bar { } // error
```
"##,

E0243: r##"
This error indicates that not enough type parameters were found in a type or
trait.

For example, the `Foo` struct below is defined to be generic in `T`, but the
type parameter is missing in the definition of `Bar`:

```
struct Foo<T> { x: T }

struct Bar { x: Foo }
```
"##,

E0244: r##"
This error indicates that too many type parameters were found in a type or
trait.

For example, the `Foo` struct below has no type parameters, but is supplied
with two in the definition of `Bar`:

```
struct Foo { x: bool }

struct Bar<S, T> { x: Foo<S, T> }
```
"##,

E0249: r##"
This error indicates a constant expression for the array length was found, but
it was not an integer (signed or unsigned) expression.

Some examples of code that produces this error are:

```
const A: [u32; "hello"] = []; // error
const B: [u32; true] = []; // error
const C: [u32; 0.0] = []; // error
"##,

E0250: r##"
This means there was an error while evaluating the expression for the length of
a fixed-size array type.

Some examples of code that produces this error are:

```
// divide by zero in the length expression
const A: [u32; 1/0] = [];

// Rust currently will not evaluate the function `foo` at compile time
fn foo() -> usize { 12 }
const B: [u32; foo()] = [];

// it is an error to try to add `u8` and `f64`
use std::{f64, u8};
const C: [u32; u8::MAX + f64::EPSILON] = [];
```
