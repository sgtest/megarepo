E0023: r##"
A pattern used to match against an enum variant must provide a sub-pattern for
each field of the enum variant. This error indicates that a pattern attempted to
extract an incorrect number of fields from a variant.

```
enum Fruit {
    Apple(String, String)
    Pear(u32)
}
```

Here the `Apple` variant has two fields, and should be matched against like so:

```
// Correct.
match x {
    Apple(a, b) => ...
}
```

Matching with the wrong number of fields has no sensible interpretation:

```
// Incorrect.
match x {
    Apple(a) => ...,
    Apple(a, b, c) => ...
}
```

Check how many fields the enum was declared with and ensure that your pattern
uses the same number.
"##,

E0024: r##"
This error indicates that a pattern attempted to extract the fields of an enum
variant with no fields. Here's a tiny example of this error:

```
// This enum has two variants.
enum Number {
    // This variant has no fields.
    Zero,
    // This variant has one field.
    One(u32)
}

// Assuming x is a Number we can pattern match on its contents.
match x {
    Zero(inside) => ...,
    One(inside) => ...
}
```

The pattern match `Zero(inside)` is incorrect because the `Zero` variant
contains no fields, yet the `inside` name attempts to bind the first field of
the enum.
"##,

E0025: r##"
Each field of a struct can only be bound once in a pattern. Erroneous code
example:

```
struct Foo {
    a: u8,
    b: u8,
}

fn main(){
    let x = Foo { a:1, b:2 };

    let Foo { a: x, a: y } = x;
    // error: field `a` bound multiple times in the pattern
}
```

Each occurrence of a field name binds the value of that field, so to fix this
error you will have to remove or alter the duplicate uses of the field name.
Perhaps you misspelled another field name? Example:

```
struct Foo {
    a: u8,
    b: u8,
}

fn main(){
    let x = Foo { a:1, b:2 };

    let Foo { a: x, b: y } = x; // ok!
}
```
"##,

E0026: r##"
This error indicates that a struct pattern attempted to extract a non-existent
field from a struct. Struct fields are identified by the name used before the
colon `:` so struct patterns should resemble the declaration of the struct type
being matched.

```
// Correct matching.
struct Thing {
    x: u32,
    y: u32
}

let thing = Thing { x: 1, y: 2 };
match thing {
    Thing { x: xfield, y: yfield } => ...
}
```

If you are using shorthand field patterns but want to refer to the struct field
by a different name, you should rename it explicitly.

```
// Change this:
match thing {
    Thing { x, z } => ...
}

// To this:
match thing {
    Thing { x, y: z } => ...
}
```
"##,

E0027: r##"
This error indicates that a pattern for a struct fails to specify a sub-pattern
for every one of the struct's fields. Ensure that each field from the struct's
definition is mentioned in the pattern, or use `..` to ignore unwanted fields.

For example:

```
struct Dog {
    name: String,
    age: u32
}

let d = Dog { name: "Rusty".to_string(), age: 8 };

// This is incorrect.
match d {
    Dog { age: x } => ...
}

// This is correct (explicit).
match d {
    Dog { name: n, age: x } => ...
}

// This is also correct (ignore unused fields).
match d {
    Dog { age: x, .. } => ...
}
```
"##,

E0029: r##"
In a match expression, only numbers and characters can be matched against a
range. This is because the compiler checks that the range is non-empty at
compile-time, and is unable to evaluate arbitrary comparison functions. If you
want to capture values of an orderable type between two end-points, you can use
a guard.

```
// The ordering relation for strings can't be evaluated at compile time,
// so this doesn't work:
match string {
    "hello" ... "world" => ...
    _ => ...
}

// This is a more general version, using a guard:
match string {
    s if s >= "hello" && s <= "world" => ...
    _ => ...
}
```
"##,

E0033: r##"
This error indicates that a pointer to a trait type cannot be implicitly
dereferenced by a pattern. Every trait defines a type, but because the
size of trait implementors isn't fixed, this type has no compile-time size.
Therefore, all accesses to trait types must be through pointers. If you
encounter this error you should try to avoid dereferencing the pointer.

```
let trait_obj: &SomeTrait = ...;

// This tries to implicitly dereference to create an unsized local variable.
let &invalid = trait_obj;

// You can call methods without binding to the value being pointed at.
trait_obj.method_one();
trait_obj.method_two();
```

You can read more about trait objects in the Trait Object section of the
Reference:

https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html#trait-objects
"##,

E0034: r##"
The compiler doesn't know what method to call because more than one method
has the same prototype. Example:

```
struct Test;

trait Trait1 {
    fn foo();
}

trait Trait2 {
    fn foo();
}

impl Trait1 for Test { fn foo() {} }
impl Trait2 for Test { fn foo() {} }

fn main() {
    Test::foo() // error, which foo() to call?
}
```

To avoid this error, you have to keep only one of them and remove the others.
So let's take our example and fix it:

```
struct Test;

trait Trait1 {
    fn foo();
}

impl Trait1 for Test { fn foo() {} }

fn main() {
    Test::foo() // and now that's good!
}
```

However, a better solution would be using fully explicit naming of type and
trait:

```
struct Test;

trait Trait1 {
    fn foo();
}

trait Trait2 {
    fn foo();
}

impl Trait1 for Test { fn foo() {} }
impl Trait2 for Test { fn foo() {} }

fn main() {
    <Test as Trait1>::foo()
}
```
"##,

E0035: r##"
You tried to give a type parameter where it wasn't needed. Bad example:

```
struct Test;

impl Test {
    fn method(&self) {}
}

fn main() {
    let x = Test;

    x.method::<i32>(); // Error: Test::method doesn't need type parameter!
}
```

To fix this error, just remove the type parameter:

```
struct Test;

impl Test {
    fn method(&self) {}
}

fn main() {
    let x = Test;

    x.method(); // OK, we're good!
}
```
"##,

E0036: r##"
This error occurrs when you pass too many or not enough type parameters to
a method. Example:

```
struct Test;

impl Test {
    fn method<T>(&self, v: &[T]) -> usize {
        v.len()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = Test;
    let v = &[0i32];

    x.method::<i32, i32>(v); // error: only one type parameter is expected!
}
```

To fix it, just specify a correct number of type parameters:

```
struct Test;

impl Test {
    fn method<T>(&self, v: &[T]) -> usize {
        v.len()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = Test;
    let v = &[0i32];

    x.method::<i32>(v); // OK, we're good!
}
```

Please note on the last example that we could have called `method` like this:

```
x.method(v);
```
"##,

E0040: r##"
It is not allowed to manually call destructors in Rust. It is also not
necessary to do this since `drop` is called automatically whenever a value goes
out of scope.

Here's an example of this error:

```
struct Foo {
    x: i32,
}

impl Drop for Foo {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("kaboom");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut x = Foo { x: -7 };
    x.drop(); // error: explicit use of destructor method
}
```
"##,

E0044: r##"
You can't use type parameters on foreign items. Example of erroneous code:

```
extern { fn some_func<T>(x: T); }
```

To fix this, replace the type parameter with the specializations that you
need:

```
extern { fn some_func_i32(x: i32); }
extern { fn some_func_i64(x: i64); }
```
"##,

E0045: r##"
Rust only supports variadic parameters for interoperability with C code in its
FFI. As such, variadic parameters can only be used with functions which are
using the C ABI. Examples of erroneous code:

```
extern "rust-call" { fn foo(x: u8, ...); }
// or
fn foo(x: u8, ...) {}
```

To fix such code, put them in an extern "C" block:

```
extern "C" fn foo (x: u8, ...);
// or:
extern "C" {
    fn foo (x: u8, ...);
}
```
"##,

E0046: r##"
Items are missing in a trait implementation. Erroneous code example:

```
trait Foo {
    fn foo();
}

struct Bar;

impl Foo for Bar {}
// error: not all trait items implemented, missing: `foo`
```

When trying to make some type implement a trait `Foo`, you must, at minimum,
provide implementations for all of `Foo`'s required methods (meaning the
methods that do not have default implementations), as well as any required
trait items like associated types or constants. Example:

```
trait Foo {
    fn foo();
}

struct Bar;

impl Foo for Bar {
    fn foo() {} // ok!
}
```
"##,

E0049: r##"
This error indicates that an attempted implementation of a trait method
has the wrong number of type parameters.

For example, the trait below has a method `foo` with a type parameter `T`,
but the implementation of `foo` for the type `Bar` is missing this parameter:

```
trait Foo {
    fn foo<T: Default>(x: T) -> Self;
}

struct Bar;

// error: method `foo` has 0 type parameters but its trait declaration has 1
// type parameter
impl Foo for Bar {
    fn foo(x: bool) -> Self { Bar }
}
```
"##,

E0050: r##"
This error indicates that an attempted implementation of a trait method
has the wrong number of function parameters.

For example, the trait below has a method `foo` with two function parameters
(`&self` and `u8`), but the implementation of `foo` for the type `Bar` omits
the `u8` parameter:

```
trait Foo {
    fn foo(&self, x: u8) -> bool;
}

struct Bar;

// error: method `foo` has 1 parameter but the declaration in trait `Foo::foo`
// has 2
impl Foo for Bar {
    fn foo(&self) -> bool { true }
}
```
"##,

E0053: r##"
The parameters of any trait method must match between a trait implementation
and the trait definition.

Here are a couple examples of this error:

```
trait Foo {
    fn foo(x: u16);
    fn bar(&self);
}

struct Bar;

impl Foo for Bar {
    // error, expected u16, found i16
    fn foo(x: i16) { }

    // error, values differ in mutability
    fn bar(&mut self) { }
}
```
"##,

E0054: r##"
It is not allowed to cast to a bool. If you are trying to cast a numeric type
to a bool, you can compare it with zero instead:

```
let x = 5;

// Ok
let x_is_nonzero = x != 0;

// Not allowed, won't compile
let x_is_nonzero = x as bool;
```
"##,

E0055: r##"
During a method call, a value is automatically dereferenced as many times as
needed to make the value's type match the method's receiver. The catch is that
the compiler will only attempt to dereference a number of times up to the
recursion limit (which can be set via the `recursion_limit` attribute).

For a somewhat artificial example:

```
#![recursion_limit="2"]

struct Foo;

impl Foo {
    fn foo(&self) {}
}

fn main() {
    let foo = Foo;
    let ref_foo = &&Foo;

    // error, reached the recursion limit while auto-dereferencing &&Foo
    ref_foo.foo();
}
```

One fix may be to increase the recursion limit. Note that it is possible to
create an infinite recursion of dereferencing, in which case the only fix is to
somehow break the recursion.
"##,

E0057: r##"
When invoking closures or other implementations of the function traits `Fn`,
`FnMut` or `FnOnce` using call notation, the number of parameters passed to the
function must match its definition.

An example using a closure:

```
let f = |x| x * 3;
let a = f();        // invalid, too few parameters
let b = f(4);       // this works!
let c = f(2, 3);    // invalid, too many parameters
```

A generic function must be treated similarly:

```
fn foo<F: Fn()>(f: F) {
    f(); // this is valid, but f(3) would not work
}
```
"##,

E0059: r##"
The built-in function traits are generic over a tuple of the function arguments.
If one uses angle-bracket notation (`Fn<(T,), Output=U>`) instead of parentheses
(`Fn(T) -> U`) to denote the function trait, the type parameter should be a
tuple. Otherwise function call notation cannot be used and the trait will not be
implemented by closures.

The most likely source of this error is using angle-bracket notation without
wrapping the function argument type into a tuple, for example:

```
fn foo<F: Fn<i32>>(f: F) -> F::Output { f(3) }
```

It can be fixed by adjusting the trait bound like this:

```
fn foo<F: Fn<(i32,)>>(f: F) -> F::Output { f(3) }
```

Note that `(T,)` always denotes the type of a 1-tuple containing an element of
type `T`. The comma is necessary for syntactic disambiguation.
"##,

E0060: r##"
External C functions are allowed to be variadic. However, a variadic function
takes a minimum number of arguments. For example, consider C's variadic `printf`
function:

```
extern crate libc;
use libc::{ c_char, c_int };

extern "C" {
    fn printf(_: *const c_char, ...) -> c_int;
}
```

Using this declaration, it must be called with at least one argument, so
simply calling `printf()` is invalid. But the following uses are allowed:

```
unsafe {
    use std::ffi::CString;

    printf(CString::new("test\n").unwrap().as_ptr());
    printf(CString::new("number = %d\n").unwrap().as_ptr(), 3);
    printf(CString::new("%d, %d\n").unwrap().as_ptr(), 10, 5);
}
```
"##,

E0061: r##"
The number of arguments passed to a function must match the number of arguments
specified in the function signature.

For example, a function like

```
fn f(a: u16, b: &str) {}
```

must always be called with exactly two arguments, e.g. `f(2, "test")`.

Note, that Rust does not have a notion of optional function arguments or
variadic functions (except for its C-FFI).
"##,

E0062: r##"
This error indicates that during an attempt to build a struct or struct-like
enum variant, one of the fields was specified more than once. Erroneous code
example:

```
struct Foo {
    x: i32
}

fn main() {
    let x = Foo {
                x: 0,
                x: 0, // error: field `x` specified more than once
            };
}
```

Each field should be specified exactly one time. Example:

```
struct Foo {
    x: i32
}

fn main() {
    let x = Foo { x: 0 }; // ok!
}
```
"##,

E0063: r##"
This error indicates that during an attempt to build a struct or struct-like
enum variant, one of the fields was not provided. Erroneous code example:

```
struct Foo {
    x: i32,
    y: i32
}

fn main() {
    let x = Foo { x: 0 }; // error: missing field: `y`
}
```

Each field should be specified exactly once. Example:

```
struct Foo {

    y: i32
}

fn main() {
    let x = Foo { x: 0, y: 0 }; // ok!

Box placement expressions (like C++'s "placement new") do not yet support any
place expression except the exchange heap (i.e. `std::boxed::HEAP`).
Furthermore, the syntax is changing to use `in` instead of `box`. See [RFC 470]
and [RFC 809] for more details.

The left-hand side of a compound assignment expression must be an lvalue
expression. An lvalue expression represents a memory location and includes
item paths (ie, namespaced variables), dereferences, indexing expressions,
and field references.

Let's start with some bad examples:

```
use std::collections::LinkedList;

// Bad: assignment to non-lvalue expression
LinkedList::new() += 1;

// ...

fn some_func(i: &mut i32) {
    i += 12; // Error : '+=' operation cannot be applied on a reference !
}
```

And now some good examples:

```
let mut i : i32 = 0;

i += 12; // Good !

// ...

fn some_func(i: &mut i32) {
    *i += 12; // Good !
}
```
"##,

E0069: r##"
The compiler found a function whose body contains a `return;` statement but
whose return type is not `()`. An example of this is:

```
// error
fn foo() -> u8 {
    return;
}
```

Since `return;` is just like `return ();`, there is a mismatch between the
function's return type and the value being returned.
"##,

E0070: r##"
The left-hand side of an assignment operator must be an lvalue expression. An
lvalue expression represents a memory location and can be a variable (with
optional namespacing), a dereference, an indexing expression or a field
reference.

More details can be found here:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html#lvalues-rvalues-and-temporaries

Now, we can go further. Here are some bad examples:

```
struct SomeStruct {
    x: i32,
    y: i32
}
const SOME_CONST : i32 = 12;

fn some_other_func() {}

fn some_function() {
    SOME_CONST = 14; // error : a constant value cannot be changed!
    1 = 3; // error : 1 isn't a valid lvalue!
    some_other_func() = 4; // error : we can't assign value to a function!
    SomeStruct.x = 12; // error : SomeStruct a structure name but it is used
                       // like a variable!
}
```

And now let's give good examples:

```
struct SomeStruct {
    x: i32,
    y: i32
}
let mut s = SomeStruct {x: 0, y: 0};

s.x = 3; // that's good !

// ...

fn some_func(x: &mut i32) {
    *x = 12; // that's good !
}
```
"##,

E0071: r##"
You tried to use structure-literal syntax to create an item that is
not a struct-style structure or enum variant.

Example of erroneous code:

```
enum Foo { FirstValue(i32) };

let u = Foo::FirstValue { value: 0i32 }; // error: Foo::FirstValue
                                         // isn't a structure!
// or even simpler, if the name doesn't refer to a structure at all.
let t = u32 { value: 4 }; // error: `u32` does not name a structure.
```

To fix this, ensure that the name was correctly spelled, and that
the correct form of initializer was used.

For example, the code above can be fixed to:

```
enum Foo {
    FirstValue(i32)
}

fn main() {
    let u = Foo::FirstValue(0i32);

    let t = 4;
}
```
"##,

E0073: r##"
You cannot define a struct (or enum) `Foo` that requires an instance of `Foo`
in order to make a new `Foo` value. This is because there would be no way a
first instance of `Foo` could be made to initialize another instance!

Here's an example of a struct that has this problem:

```
struct Foo { x: Box<Foo> } // error
```

One fix is to use `Option`, like so:

```
struct Foo { x: Option<Box<Foo>> }
```

Now it's possible to create at least one instance of `Foo`: `Foo { x: None }`.

When using the `#[simd]` attribute on a tuple struct, the components of the
tuple struct must all be of a concrete, nongeneric type so the compiler can
reason about how to use SIMD with them. This error will occur if the types
are generic.

```
#[simd]
struct Bad<T>(T, T, T); // This will cause an error

#[simd]
struct Good(u32, u32, u32); // This will not
```
"##,

E0075: r##"
The `#[simd]` attribute can only be applied to non empty tuple structs, because
it doesn't make sense to try to use SIMD operations when there are no values to
operate on.

```
#[simd]
struct Bad; // This will cause an error

#[simd]
struct Good(u32); // This will not
```
"##,

E0076: r##"
When using the `#[simd]` attribute to automatically use SIMD operations in tuple
struct, the types in the struct must all be of the same type, or the compiler
will trigger this error.

```
#[simd]
struct Bad(u16, u32, u32); // This will cause an error

#[simd]
struct Good(u32, u32, u32); // This will not
```

"##,

E0077: r##"
When using the `#[simd]` attribute on a tuple struct, the elements in the tuple
must be machine types so SIMD operations can be applied to them.

```
#[simd]
struct Bad(String); // This will cause an error

#[simd]
struct Good(u32, u32, u32); // This will not
```
"##,

E0079: r##"
Enum variants which contain no data can be given a custom integer
representation. This error indicates that the value provided is not an integer
literal and is therefore invalid.

For example, in the following code,

```
enum Foo {
    Q = "32"
}
```

we try to set the representation to a string.

There's no general fix for this; if you can work with an integer then just set
it to one:

```
enum Foo {
    Q = 32
}
```

however if you actually wanted a mapping between variants and non-integer
objects, it may be preferable to use a method with a match instead:

```
enum Foo { Q }
impl Foo {
    fn get_str(&self) -> &'static str {
        match *self {
            Foo::Q => "32",
        }
    }
}
```
"##,

E0080: r##"
This error indicates that the compiler was unable to sensibly evaluate an
integer expression provided as an enum discriminant. Attempting to divide by 0
or causing integer overflow are two ways to induce this error. For example:

```
enum Enum {
    X = (1 << 500),
    Y = (1 / 0)
}
```

Ensure that the expressions given can be evaluated as the desired integer type.
See the FFI section of the Reference for more information about using a custom
integer type:

https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html#ffi-attributes
"##,

E0081: r##"
Enum discriminants are used to differentiate enum variants stored in memory.
This error indicates that the same value was used for two or more variants,
making them impossible to tell apart.

```
// Good.
enum Enum {
    P,
    X = 3,
    Y = 5
}

// Bad.
enum Enum {
    P = 3,
    X = 3,
    Y = 5
}
```

Note that variants without a manually specified discriminant are numbered from
top to bottom starting from 0, so clashes can occur with seemingly unrelated
variants.

```
enum Bad {
    X,
    Y = 0
}
```

Here `X` will have already been assigned the discriminant 0 by the time `Y` is
encountered, so a conflict occurs.
"##,

E0082: r##"
The default type for enum discriminants is `isize`, but it can be adjusted by
adding the `repr` attribute to the enum declaration. This error indicates that
an integer literal given as a discriminant is not a member of the discriminant
type. For example:

```
#[repr(u8)]
enum Thing {
    A = 1024,
    B = 5
}
```

Here, 1024 lies outside the valid range for `u8`, so the discriminant for `A` is
invalid. You may want to change representation types to fix this, or else change
invalid discriminant values so that they fit within the existing type.

Note also that without a representation manually defined, the compiler will
optimize by using the smallest integer type possible.

At present, it's not possible to define a custom representation for an enum with
a single variant. As a workaround you can add a `Dummy` variant.

See: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10292
"##,

E0084: r##"
It is impossible to define an integer type to be used to represent zero-variant
enum values because there are no zero-variant enum values. There is no way to
construct an instance of the following type using only safe code:

```
enum Empty {}
```

E0087: r##"
Too many type parameters were supplied for a function. For example:

```
fn foo<T>() {}

fn main() {
    foo::<f64, bool>(); // error, expected 1 parameter, found 2 parameters
}
```

The number of supplied parameters must exactly match the number of defined type
parameters.
"##,

E0088: r##"
You gave too many lifetime parameters. Erroneous code example:

```
fn f() {}

fn main() {
    f::<'static>() // error: too many lifetime parameters provided
}
```

Please check you give the right number of lifetime parameters. Example:

```
fn f() {}

fn main() {
    f() // ok!
}
```

It's also important to note that the Rust compiler can generally
determine the lifetime by itself. Example:

```
struct Foo {
    value: String
}

impl Foo {
    // it can be written like this
    fn get_value<'a>(&'a self) -> &'a str { &self.value }
    // but the compiler works fine with this too:
    fn without_lifetime(&self) -> &str { &self.value }
}

fn main() {
    let f = Foo { value: "hello".to_owned() };

    println!("{}", f.get_value());
    println!("{}", f.without_lifetime());
}
```
"##,

E0089: r##"
Not enough type parameters were supplied for a function. For example:

```
fn foo<T, U>() {}

fn main() {
    foo::<f64>(); // error, expected 2 parameters, found 1 parameter
}
```

Note that if a function takes multiple type parameters but you want the compiler
to infer some of them, you can use type placeholders:

```
fn foo<T, U>(x: T) {}

fn main() {
    let x: bool = true;
    foo::<f64>(x);    // error, expected 2 parameters, found 1 parameter
    foo::<_, f64>(x); // same as `foo::<bool, f64>(x)`
}
```
"##,

E0091: r##"
You gave an unnecessary type parameter in a type alias. Erroneous code
example:

```
type Foo<T> = u32; // error: type parameter `T` is unused
// or:
type Foo<A,B> = Box<A>; // error: type parameter `B` is unused
```

Please check you didn't write too many type parameters. Example:

```
type Foo = u32; // ok!
type Foo<A> = Box<A>; // ok!
```

You tried to declare an undefined atomic operation function.
Erroneous code example:

```

Please check you didn't make a mistake in the function's name. All intrinsic
functions are defined in librustc_trans/trans/intrinsic.rs and in
libcore/intrinsics.rs in the Rust source code. Example:

```
#![feature(intrinsics)]

extern "rust-intrinsic" {
    fn atomic_fence(); // ok!

        foo();
    }
}
```

Please check you didn't make a mistake in the function's name. All intrinsic
functions are defined in librustc_trans/trans/intrinsic.rs and in
libcore/intrinsics.rs in the Rust source code. Example:

```
#![feature(intrinsics)]

You gave an invalid number of type parameters to an intrinsic function.
Erroneous code example:

                                 //        of type parameters

Please check that you provided the right number of lifetime parameters

You hit this error because the compiler lacks the information to
determine a type for this expression. Erroneous code example:

```
fn main() {
    let x = |_| {}; // error: cannot determine a type for this expression
}
```

You have two possibilities to solve this situation:
 * Give an explicit definition of the expression
 * Infer the expression

Examples:

```
fn main() {
    let x = |_ : u32| {}; // ok!
    // or:
    let x = |_| {};
    x(0u32);
}
```
"##,

E0102: r##"
You hit this error because the compiler lacks information to
determine a type for this variable. Erroneous code example:

}

fn oh_no() -> ! { panic!("the devil is in the details") }

fn main() {
    demo(oh_no);
}
```

To solve this situation, constrain the type of the variable.
Examples:

```
fn some_func(x: &u32) {
    // some code
}

fn demo(devil: fn () -> !) {
    let x: &u32 = devil();
    // Here we defined the type at the variable creation

    let x: &_ = devil();
    some_func(x);

fn main() {

This error indicates that a lifetime is missing from a type. If it is an error
inside a function signature, the problem may be with failing to adhere to the
lifetime elision rules (see below).

Here are some simple examples of where you'll run into this error:

```
struct Foo { x: &bool }        // error
struct Foo<'a> { x: &'a bool } // correct

enum Bar { A(u8), B(&bool), }        // error
enum Bar<'a> { A(u8), B(&'a bool), } // correct

type MyStr = &str;        // error
type MyStr<'a> = &'a str; // correct
```

Lifetime elision is a special, limited kind of inference for lifetimes in
function signatures which allows you to leave out lifetimes in certain cases.
For more background on lifetime elision see [the book][book-le].

The lifetime elision rules require that any function signature with an elided
output lifetime must either have

 - exactly one input lifetime
 - or, multiple input lifetimes, but the function must also be a method with a
   `&self` or `&mut self` receiver

In the first case, the output lifetime is inferred to be the same as the unique
input lifetime. In the second case, the lifetime is instead inferred to be the
same as the lifetime on `&self` or `&mut self`.

Here are some examples of elision errors:

```
// error, no input lifetimes
fn foo() -> &str { ... }

// error, `x` and `y` have distinct lifetimes inferred
fn bar(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str { ... }

// error, `y`'s lifetime is inferred to be distinct from `x`'s
fn baz<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &str) -> &str { ... }
```

"##,

E0107: r##"
This error means that an incorrect number of lifetime parameters were provided
for a type (like a struct or enum) or trait.

Some basic examples include:

```
struct Foo<'a>(&'a str);
enum Bar { A, B, C }

struct Baz<'a> {
    foo: Foo,     // error: expected 1, found 0
    bar: Bar<'a>, // error: expected 0, found 1
}
```

Here's an example that is currently an error, but may work in a future version
of Rust:

```
struct Foo<'a>(&'a str);

trait Quux { }
impl Quux for Foo { } // error: expected 1, found 0
```

Lifetime elision in implementation headers was part of the lifetime elision
RFC. It is, however, [currently unimplemented][iss15872].

"##,

E0116: r##"
You can only define an inherent implementation for a type in the same crate
where the type was defined. For example, an `impl` block as below is not allowed
since `Vec` is defined in the standard library:

```
impl Vec<u8> { ... } // error
```

To fix this problem, you can do either of these things:

 - define a trait that has the desired associated functions/types/constants and
   implement the trait for the type in question
 - define a new type wrapping the type and define an implementation on the new
   type

Note that using the `type` keyword does not work here because `type` only
introduces a type alias:

```
type Bytes = Vec<u8>;

impl Bytes { ... } // error, same as above
```
"##,

E0117: r##"
This error indicates a violation of one of Rust's orphan rules for trait
implementations. The rule prohibits any implementation of a foreign trait (a
trait defined in another crate) where

 - the type that is implementing the trait is foreign
 - all of the parameters being passed to the trait (if there are any) are also
   foreign.

Here's one example of this error:

```
impl Drop for u32 {}
```

To avoid this kind of error, ensure that at least one local type is referenced
by the `impl`:

```
pub struct Foo; // you define your type in your crate

impl Drop for Foo { // and you can implement the trait on it!
    // code of trait implementation here
}

impl From<Foo> for i32 { // or you use a type from your crate as
                         // a type parameter
    fn from(i: Foo) -> i32 {
        0
    }
}
```

Alternatively, define a trait locally and implement that instead:

```
trait Bar {
    fn get(&self) -> usize;
}

impl Bar for u32 {
    fn get(&self) -> usize { 0 }
}
```

For information on the design of the orphan rules, see [RFC 1023].

[RFC 1023]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1023
"##,

E0118: r##"
Rust can't find a base type for an implementation you are providing, or the type
cannot have an implementation. For example, only a named type or a trait can
have an implementation:

```
type NineString = [char, ..9] // This isn't a named type (struct, enum or trait)
impl NineString {
    // Some code here
}
```

In the other, simpler case, Rust just can't find the type you are providing an
impelementation for:

```
impl SomeTypeThatDoesntExist {  }
```
"##,

E0119: r##"
There are conflicting trait implementations for the same type.
Example of erroneous code:

```
trait MyTrait {
    fn get(&self) -> usize;
}

impl<T> MyTrait for T {
    fn get(&self) -> usize { 0 }
}

struct Foo {
    value: usize
}

impl MyTrait for Foo { // error: conflicting implementations of trait
                       //        `MyTrait` for type `Foo`
    fn get(&self) -> usize { self.value }
}
```

When looking for the implementation for the trait, the compiler finds
both the `impl<T> MyTrait for T` where T is all types and the `impl
MyTrait for Foo`. Since a trait cannot be implemented multiple times,
this is an error. So, when you write:

```
impl<T> MyTrait for T {
    fn get(&self) -> usize { 0 }
}
```

This makes the trait implemented on all types in the scope. So if you
try to implement it on another one after that, the implementations will
conflict. Example:

```
trait MyTrait {
    fn get(&self) -> usize;
}

impl<T> MyTrait for T {
    fn get(&self) -> usize { 0 }
}

struct Foo;

fn main() {
    let f = Foo;

    f.get(); // the trait is implemented so we can use it
}
```
"##,

E0120: r##"
An attempt was made to implement Drop on a trait, which is not allowed: only
structs and enums can implement Drop. An example causing this error:

```
trait MyTrait {}

impl Drop for MyTrait {
    fn drop(&mut self) {}
}
```

A workaround for this problem is to wrap the trait up in a struct, and implement
Drop on that. An example is shown below:

```
trait MyTrait {}
struct MyWrapper<T: MyTrait> { foo: T }

impl <T: MyTrait> Drop for MyWrapper<T> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {}
}

```

Alternatively, wrapping trait objects requires something like the following:

```
trait MyTrait {}

//or Box<MyTrait>, if you wanted an owned trait object
struct MyWrapper<'a> { foo: &'a MyTrait }

impl <'a> Drop for MyWrapper<'a> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {}
}
```
"##,

E0121: r##"
In order to be consistent with Rust's lack of global type inference, type
placeholders are disallowed by design in item signatures.

static BAR: _ = "test"; // error, explicitly write out the type instead
```
"##,

E0122: r##"
An attempt was made to add a generic constraint to a type alias. While Rust will
allow this with a warning, it will not currently enforce the constraint.
Consider the example below:

```
trait Foo{}

type MyType<R: Foo> = (R, ());

fn main() {
    let t: MyType<u32>;
}
```

We're able to declare a variable of type `MyType<u32>`, despite the fact that
`u32` does not implement `Foo`. As a result, one should avoid using generic
constraints in concert with type aliases.
"##,

E0124: r##"
You declared two fields of a struct with the same name. Erroneous code
example:

```
struct Foo {

Please verify that the field names have been correctly spelled. Example:

```
struct Foo {

Type parameter defaults can only use parameters that occur before them.

```
pub struct Foo<T=U, U=()> {
    field1: T,
    filed2: U,

// error: type parameters with a default cannot use forward declared
// identifiers
```

Since type parameters are evaluated in-order, you may be able to fix this issue
by doing:

```
pub struct Foo<U=(), T=U> {
    field1: T,
    filed2: U,
}
```

Please also verify that this wasn't because of a name-clash and rename the type
parameter if so.

You declared a pattern as an argument in a foreign function declaration.

}
```

Please replace the pattern argument with a regular one. Example:

```
struct SomeStruct {
    a: u32,
    b: u32,
}

    fn foo(s: SomeStruct); // ok!

This error means that the compiler found a return expression in a function
marked as diverging. A function diverges if it has `!` in the place of the
return type in its signature. For example:

```
fn foo() -> ! { return; } // error
```

For a function that diverges, every control path in the function must never
return, for example with a `loop` that never breaks or a call to another
diverging function (such as `panic!()`).
"##,

E0172: r##"
This error means that an attempt was made to specify the type of a variable with
a combination of a concrete type and a trait. Consider the following example:

```
fn foo(bar: i32+std::fmt::Display) {}
```

The code is trying to specify that we want to receive a signed 32-bit integer
which also implements `Display`. This doesn't make sense: when we pass `i32`, a
concrete type, it implicitly includes all of the traits that it implements.
This includes `Display`, `Debug`, `Clone`, and a host of others.

If `i32` implements the trait we desire, there's no need to specify the trait
separately. If it does not, then we need to `impl` the trait for `i32` before
passing it into `foo`. Either way, a fixed definition for `foo` will look like
the following:

```
fn foo(bar: i32) {}
```

To learn more about traits, take a look at the Book:

https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/traits.html
"##,

E0178: r##"
In types, the `+` type operator has low precedence, so it is often necessary
to use parentheses.

    x: &'a Foo + 'a,     // error, use &'a (Foo + 'a)
    y: &'a mut Foo + 'a, // error, use &'a mut (Foo + 'a)
    z: fn() -> Foo + 'a, // error, use fn() -> (Foo + 'a)

Explicitly implementing both Drop and Copy for a type is currently disallowed.

Negative impls are only allowed for traits with default impls. For more

`where` clauses must use generic type parameters: it does not make sense to use
them otherwise. An example causing this error:

```
trait Foo {

#[derive(Copy,Clone)]
struct Wrapper<T> {
    Wrapped: T
}

impl Foo for Wrapper<u32> where Wrapper<u32>: Clone {
    fn bar(&self) { }

```

This use of a `where` clause is strange - a more common usage would look
something like the following:

```
impl <T> Foo for Wrapper<T> where Wrapper<T>: Clone {
    fn bar(&self) { }
}
```

Here, we're saying that the implementation exists on Wrapper only when the
wrapped type `T` implements `Clone`. The `where` clause is important because
some types will not implement `Clone`, and thus will not get this method.

In our erroneous example, however, we're referencing a single concrete type.
Since we know for certain that `Wrapper<u32>` implements `Clone`, there's no
reason to also specify it in a `where` clause.

A type parameter was declared which shadows an existing one. An example of this
error:

```
trait Foo<T> {

```

In this example, the trait `Foo` and the trait method `do_something_else` both
define a type parameter `T`. This is not allowed: if the method wishes to
define a type parameter, it must use a different name for it.

Your method's lifetime parameters do not match the trait declaration.
Erroneous code example:

```

The lifetime constraint `'b` for bar() implementation does not match the
trait declaration. Ensure lifetime declarations match exactly in both trait
declaration and implementation. Example:

```
trait Trait {
    fn t<'a,'b:'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str);

Inherent implementations (one that do not implement a trait but provide
methods associated with a type) are always safe because they are not
implementing an unsafe trait. Removing the `unsafe` keyword from the inherent

"##,

E0198: r##"
A negative implementation is one that excludes a type from implementing a
particular trait. Not being able to use a trait is always a safe operation,
so negative implementations are always safe and never need to be marked as

struct Foo;

// unsafe is unnecessary
unsafe impl !Clone for Foo { }
// this will compile
impl !Clone for Foo { }
```
"##,

E0199: r##"
Safe traits should not have unsafe implementations, therefore marking an
implementation for a safe trait unsafe will cause a compiler error. Removing the
unsafe marker on the trait noted in the error will resolve this problem.

// this won't compile because Bar is safe
unsafe impl Bar for Foo { }

An attempt to implement the `Copy` trait for a struct failed because one of the
fields does not implement `Copy`. To fix this, you must implement `Copy` for the
mentioned field. Note that this may not be possible, as in the example of

```
struct Foo {
    foo : Vec<u32>,
}

impl Copy for Foo { }
```

This fails because `Vec<T>` does not implement `Copy` for any `T`.

Here's another example that will fail:

```
#[derive(Copy)]
struct Foo<'a> {
    ty: &'a mut bool,
}
```

This fails because `&mut T` is not `Copy`, even when `T` is `Copy` (this
differs from the behavior for `&T`, which is always `Copy`).

You can only implement `Copy` for a struct or enum. Both of the following

You declared an unused type parameter when implementing a trait on an object.
Erroneous code example:

impl MyTrait for Foo {
    fn get(&self) -> usize {
        0

"##,

E0210: r##"
This error indicates a violation of one of Rust's orphan rules for trait
implementations. The rule concerns the use of type parameters in an
implementation of a foreign trait (a trait defined in another crate), and
states that type parameters must be "covered" by a local type. To understand
what this means, it is perhaps easiest to consider a few examples.

If `ForeignTrait` is a trait defined in some external crate `foo`, then the
following trait `impl` is an error:

```
extern crate foo;
use foo::ForeignTrait;

impl<T> ForeignTrait for T { ... } // error
```

To work around this, it can be covered with a local type, `MyType`:

```
struct MyType<T>(T);
impl<T> ForeignTrait for MyType<T> { ... } // Ok
```

For another example of an error, suppose there's another trait defined in `foo`
named `ForeignTrait2` that takes two type parameters. Then this `impl` results
in the same rule violation:

```
struct MyType2;
impl<T> ForeignTrait2<T, MyType<T>> for MyType2 { ... } // error
```

The reason for this is that there are two appearances of type parameter `T` in
the `impl` header, both as parameters for `ForeignTrait2`. The first appearance
is uncovered, and so runs afoul of the orphan rule.

Consider one more example:

```
impl<T> ForeignTrait2<MyType<T>, T> for MyType2 { ... } // Ok
```

This only differs from the previous `impl` in that the parameters `T` and
`MyType<T>` for `ForeignTrait2` have been swapped. This example does *not*
violate the orphan rule; it is permitted.

To see why that last example was allowed, you need to understand the general
rule. Unfortunately this rule is a bit tricky to state. Consider an `impl`:

```
impl<P1, ..., Pm> ForeignTrait<T1, ..., Tn> for T0 { ... }
```

where `P1, ..., Pm` are the type parameters of the `impl` and `T0, ..., Tn`
are types. One of the types `T0, ..., Tn` must be a local type (this is another
orphan rule, see the explanation for E0117). Let `i` be the smallest integer
such that `Ti` is a local type. Then no type parameter can appear in any of the
`Tj` for `j < i`.

For information on the design of the orphan rules, see [RFC 1023].

You used a function or type which doesn't fit the requirements for where it was
used. Erroneous code examples:

```
#![feature(intrinsics)]

extern "rust-intrinsic" {
    fn size_of<T>(); // error: intrinsic has wrong type
}

// or:

fn main() -> i32 { 0 }
// error: main function expects type: `fn() {main}`: expected (), found i32

// or:

let x = 1u8;
match x {
    0u8...3i8 => (),
    // error: mismatched types in range: expected u8, found i8
    _ => ()
}

// or:

use std::rc::Rc;
struct Foo;

impl Foo {
    fn x(self: Rc<Foo>) {}
    // error: mismatched self type: expected `Foo`: expected struct
    //        `Foo`, found struct `alloc::rc::Rc`
}
```

For the first code example, please check the function definition. Example:

```
#![feature(intrinsics)]

extern "rust-intrinsic" {
    fn size_of<T>() -> usize; // ok!
}
```

The second case example is a bit particular : the main function must always
have this definition:

```
fn main();
```

They never take parameters and never return types.

For the third example, when you match, all patterns must have the same type
as the type you're matching on. Example:

```
let x = 1u8;
match x {
    0u8...3u8 => (), // ok!
    _ => ()
}
```

And finally, for the last example, only `Box<Self>`, `&Self`, `Self`,
or `&mut Self` work as explicit self parameters. Example:

```
struct Foo;

impl Foo {
    fn x(self: Box<Foo>) {} // ok!
}
```

A generic type was described using parentheses rather than angle brackets. For
example:

```
fn main() {
    let v: Vec(&str) = vec!["foo"];

This is not currently supported: `v` should be defined as `Vec<&str>`.
Parentheses are currently only used with generic types when defining parameters
for `Fn`-family traits.
"##,

E0220: r##"
You used an associated type which isn't defined in the trait.
Erroneous code example:

```
trait Trait {
    type Bar;
}

type Foo = Trait<F=i32>; // error: associated type `F` not found for
                         //        `Trait`
```

Please verify you used the right trait or you didn't misspell the
associated type name. Example:

```
trait Trait {
    type Bar;
}

type Foo = Trait<Bar=i32>; // ok!
```
"##,

E0221: r##"
An attempt was made to retrieve an associated type, but the type was ambiguous.
For example:

```
trait T1 {}
trait T2 {}

trait Foo {
    type A: T1;
}

trait Bar : Foo {
    type A: T2;
    fn do_something() {
        let _: Self::A;
    }
}
```

In this example, `Foo` defines an associated type `A`. `Bar` inherits that type
from `Foo`, and defines another associated type of the same name. As a result,
when we attempt to use `Self::A`, it's ambiguous whether we mean the `A` defined
by `Foo` or the one defined by `Bar`.

There are two options to work around this issue. The first is simply to rename
one of the types. Alternatively, one can specify the intended type using the
following syntax:

```
fn do_something() {
    let _: <Self as Bar>::A;
}
```
"##,

E0223: r##"
An attempt was made to retrieve an associated type, but the type was ambiguous.
For example:

```
trait MyTrait {type X; }

fn main() {
    let foo: MyTrait::X;
}
```

The problem here is that we're attempting to take the type of X from MyTrait.
Unfortunately, the type of X is not defined, because it's only made concrete in
implementations of the trait. A working version of this code might look like:

```
trait MyTrait {type X; }
struct MyStruct;

impl MyTrait for MyStruct {
    type X = u32;
}

fn main() {
    let foo: <MyStruct as MyTrait>::X;
}
```

This syntax specifies that we want the X type from MyTrait, as made concrete in
MyStruct. The reason that we cannot simply use `MyStruct::X` is that MyStruct
might implement two different traits with identically-named associated types.
This syntax allows disambiguation between the two.
"##,

You attempted to use multiple types as bounds for a closure or trait object.
Rust does not currently support this. A simple example that causes this error:

```
fn main() {

}
```

Builtin traits are an exception to this rule: it's possible to have bounds of
one non-builtin type, plus any number of builtin types. For example, the
following compiles correctly:

```
fn main() {
    let _: Box<std::io::Read+Copy+Sync>;
}

This error indicates that a binary assignment operator like `+=` or `^=` was

let mut x = 12f32; // error: binary operation `<<` cannot be applied to
               //        type `f32`

x <<= 2;

To fix this error, please check that this type implements this binary
operation. Example:

```
let x = 12u32; // the `u32` type does implement the `ShlAssign` trait

x <<= 2; // ok!
```

It is also possible to overload most operators for your own type by
implementing the `[OP]Assign` traits from `std::ops`.

Another problem you might be facing is this: suppose you've overloaded the `+`
operator for some type `Foo` by implementing the `std::ops::Add` trait for
`Foo`, but you find that using `+=` does not work, as in this example:

```
use std::ops::Add;

struct Foo(u32);

impl Add for Foo {
    type Output = Foo;

    fn add(self, rhs: Foo) -> Foo {

}

fn main() {
    let mut x: Foo = Foo(5);

    Bar
}
```

Alternatively, if the type parameter was intentionally inserted, it must be
used. A simple fix is shown below:

```
enum Foo<T> {
    Bar(T)
}
```

This error may also commonly be found when working with unsafe code. For
example, when using raw pointers one may wish to specify the lifetime for
which the pointed-at data is valid. An initial attempt (below) causes this
error:

```
struct Foo<'a, T> {
    x: *const T
}
```

We want to express the constraint that Foo should not outlive `'a`, because
the data pointed to by `T` is only valid for that lifetime. The problem is
that there are no actual uses of `'a`. It's possible to work around this
by adding a PhantomData type to the struct, using it to tell the compiler
to act as if the struct contained a borrowed reference `&'a T`:

```
use std::marker::PhantomData;

struct Foo<'a, T: 'a> {
    x: *const T,
    phantom: PhantomData<&'a T>
}
```

PhantomData can also be used to express information about unused type
parameters. You can read more about it in the API documentation:

The length of the platform-intrinsic function `simd_shuffle`
wasn't specified. Erroneous code example:

```
extern "platform-intrinsic" {
    fn simd_shuffle<A,B>(a: A, b: A, c: [u32; 8]) -> B;
    // error: invalid `simd_shuffle`, needs length: `simd_shuffle`
}
```

The `simd_shuffle` function needs the length of the array passed as
last parameter in its name. Example:

```
extern "platform-intrinsic" {
    fn simd_shuffle8<A,B>(a: A, b: A, c: [u32; 8]) -> B;
}
```

A platform-specific intrinsic function has the wrong number of type
parameters. Erroneous code example:

```
#[repr(simd)]
struct f64x2(f64, f64);

extern "platform-intrinsic" {

    // error: platform-specific intrinsic has wrong number of type
    //        parameters
}
```

Please refer to the function declaration to see if it corresponds
with yours. Example:

```
#[repr(simd)]
struct f64x2(f64, f64);

extern "platform-intrinsic" {
    fn x86_mm_movemask_pd(x: f64x2) -> i32;

An unknown platform-specific intrinsic function was used. Erroneous
code example:

    // error: unrecognized platform-specific intrinsic function
}
```

Please verify that the function name wasn't misspelled, and ensure
that it is declared in the rust source code (in the file
src/librustc_platform_intrinsics/x86.rs). Example:

```
#[repr(simd)]
struct i16x8(i16, i16, i16, i16, i16, i16, i16, i16);

extern "platform-intrinsic" {
