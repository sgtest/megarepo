An informal guide to reading and working on the rustc compiler.
==================================================================

If you wish to expand on this document, or have one of the
slightly-more-familiar authors add anything else to it, please get in touch or
file a bug. Your concerns are probably the same as someone else's.


High-level concepts
===================

Rustc consists of the following subdirectories:

front/    - front-end: lexer, parser, AST.
middle/   - middle-end: resolving, typechecking, translating
driver/   - command-line processing, main() entrypoint
util/     - ubiquitous types and helper functions
lib/      - bindings to LLVM

The entry-point for the compiler is main() in driver/rustc.rs, and this file
sequences the various parts together.


The 3 central data structures:
------------------------------

#1: front/ast.rs defines the AST. The AST is treated as immutable after
    parsing despite containing some mutable types (hashtables and such).
    There are three interesting details to know about this structure:

      - Many -- though not all -- nodes within this data structure are wrapped
        in the type spanned[T], meaning that the front-end has marked the
        input coordinates of that node. The member .node is the data itself,
        the member .span is the input location (file, line, column; both low
        and high).

      - Many other nodes within this data structure carry a def_id. These
        nodes represent the 'target' of some name reference elsewhere in the
        tree. When the AST is resolved, by middle/resolve.rs, all names wind
        up acquiring a def that they point to. So anything that can be
        pointed-to by a name winds up with a def_id.

      - Many nodes carry an additional type 'ann', for annotations. These
        nodes are those that later stages of the middle-end add information
        to, augmenting the basic structure of the tree. Currently that
        includes the calculated type of any node that has a type; it will also
        likely include typestates, layers and effects, when such things are
        calculated.

#2: middle/ty.rs defines the datatype ty.t, with its central member ty.struct.
    This is the type that represents types after they have been resolved and
    normalized by the middle-end. The typeck phase converts every ast type to
    a ty.t, and the latter is used to drive later phases of compilation.  Most
    variants in the ast.ty tag have a corresponding variant in the ty.struct
    tag.

#3: lib/llvm.rs defines the exported types ValueRef, TypeRef, BasicBlockRef,
    and several others. Each of these is an opaque pointer to an LLVM type,
    manipulated through the lib.llvm interface.


Control and information flow within the compiler:
-------------------------------------------------

- main() in driver/rustc.rs assumes control on startup. Options are parsed,
  platform is detected, etc.

- front/parser.rs is driven over the input files.

- Multiple middle-end passes (middle/resolve.rs, middle/typeck.rs) are run
  over the resulting AST. Each pass produces a new AST with some number of
  annotations or modifications.

- Finally middle/trans.rs is applied to the AST, which performs a
  type-directed translation to LLVM-ese. When it's finished synthesizing LLVM
  values, rustc asks LLVM to write them out as a bitcode file, on which you
  can run the normal LLVM pipeline (opt, llc, as) to get an executable.
