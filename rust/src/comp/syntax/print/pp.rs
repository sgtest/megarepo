/*
 * This pretty-printer is a direct reimplementation of Philip Karlton's
 * Mesa pretty-printer, as described in appendix A of
 *
 *     STAN-CS-79-770: "Pretty Printing", by Derek C. Oppen.
 *     Stanford Department of Computer Science, 1979.
 *
 * The algorithm's aim is to break a stream into as few lines as possible
 * while respecting the indentation-consistency requirements of the enclosing
 * block, and avoiding breaking at silly places on block boundaries, for
 * example, between "x" and ")" in "x)".
 *
 * I am implementing this algorithm because it comes with 20 pages of
 * documentation explaining its theory, and because it addresses the set of
 * concerns I've seen other pretty-printers fall down on. Weirdly. Even though
 * it's 32 years old and not written in Haskell. What can I say?
 *
 * Despite some redundancies and quirks in the way it's implemented in that
 * paper, I've opted to keep the implementation here as similar as I can,
 * changing only what was blatantly wrong, a typo, or sufficiently
 * non-idiomatic rust that it really stuck out.
 *
 * In particular you'll see a certain amount of churn related to INTEGER vs.
 * CARDINAL in the Mesa implementation. Mesa apparently interconverts the two
 * somewhat readily? In any case, I've used uint for indices-in-buffers and
 * ints for character-sizes-and-indentation-offsets. This respects the need
 * for ints to "go negative" while carrying a pending-calculation balance, and
 * helps differentiate all the numbers flying around internally (slightly).
 *
 * I also inverted the indentation arithmetic used in the print stack, since
 * the Mesa implementation (somewhat randomly) stores the offset on the print
 * stack in terms of margin-col rather than col itself. I store col.
 *
 * I also implemented a small change in the STRING token, in that I store an
 * explicit length for the string. For most tokens this is just the length of
 * the accompanying string. But it's necessary to permit it to differ, for
 * encoding things that are supposed to "go on their own line" -- certain
 * classes of comment and blank-line -- where relying on adjacent
 * hardbreak-like BREAK tokens with long blankness indication doesn't actually
 * work. To see why, consider when there is a "thing that should be on its own
 * line" between two long blocks, say functions. If you put a hardbreak after
 * each function (or before each) and the breaking algorithm decides to break
 * there anyways (because the functions themselves are long) you wind up with
 * extra blank lines. If you don't put hardbreaks you can wind up with the
 * "thing which should be on its own line" not getting its own line in the
 * rare case of "really small functions" or such. This re-occurs with comments
 * and explicit blank lines. So in those cases we use a string with a payload
 * we want isolated to a line and an explicit length that's huge, surrounded
 * by two zero-length breaks. The algorithm will try its best to fit it on a
 * line (which it can't) and so naturally place the content on its own line to
 * avoid combining it with other lines and making matters even worse.

/*
 * In case you do not have the paper, here is an explanation of what's going
 * on.
 *
 * There is a stream of input tokens flowing through this printer.
 *
 * The printer buffers up to 3N tokens inside itself, where N is linewidth.
 * Yes, linewidth is chars and tokens are multi-char, but in the worst
 * case every token worth buffering is 1 char long, so it's ok.
 *
 * Tokens are STRING, BREAK, and BEGIN/END to delimit blocks.
 *
 * BEGIN tokens can carry an offset, saying "how far to indent when you break
 * inside here", as well as a flag indicating "consistent" or "inconsistent"
 * breaking. Consistent breaking means that after the first break, no attempt
 * will be made to flow subsequent breaks together onto lines. Inconsistent
 * is the opposite. Inconsistent breaking example would be, say:
 *
 *  foo(hello, there, good, friends)
 *
 * breaking inconsistently to become
 *
 *  foo(hello, there
 *      good, friends);
 *
 * whereas a consistent breaking would yield:
 *
 *  foo(hello,
 *      there
 *      good,
 *      friends);
 *
 * That is, in the consistent-break blocks we value vertical alignment
 * more than the ability to cram stuff onto a line. But in all cases if it
 * can make a block a one-liner, it'll do so.
 *
 * Carrying on with high-level logic:
 *
 * The buffered tokens go through a ring-buffer, 'tokens'. The 'left' and
 * 'right' indices denote the active portion of the ring buffer as well as
 * describing hypothetical points-in-the-infinite-stream at most 3N tokens
 * apart (i.e. "not wrapped to ring-buffer boundaries"). The paper will switch
 * between using 'left' and 'right' terms to denote the wrapepd-to-ring-buffer
 * and point-in-infinite-stream senses freely.
 *
 * There is a parallel ring buffer, 'size', that holds the calculated size of
 * each token. Why calculated? Because for BEGIN/END pairs, the "size"
 * includes everything betwen the pair. That is, the "size" of BEGIN is
 * actually the sum of the sizes of everything between BEGIN and the paired
 * END that follows. Since that is arbitrarily far in the future, 'size' is
 * being rewritten regularly while the printer runs; in fact most of the
 * machinery is here to work out 'size' entries on the fly (and give up when
 * they're so obviously over-long that "infinity" is a good enough
 * approximation for purposes of line breaking).
 *
 * The "input side" of the printer is managed as an abstract process called
 * SCAN, which uses 'scan_stack', 'scan_stack_empty', 'top' and 'bottom', to
 * manage calculating 'size'. SCAN is, in other words, the process of
 * calculating 'size' entries.
 *
 * The "output side" of the printer is managed by an abstract process called
 * PRINT, which uses 'print_stack', 'margin' and 'space' to figure out what to
 * do with each token/size pair it consumes as it goes. It's trying to consume
 * the entire buffered window, but can't output anything until the size is >=
 * 0 (sizes are set to negative while they're pending calculation).
 *
 * So SCAN takeks input and buffers tokens and pending calculations, while
 * PRINT gobbles up completed calculations and tokens from the buffer. The
 * theory is that the two can never get more than 3N tokens apart, because
 * once there's "obviously" too much data to fit on a line, in a size
 * calculation, SCAN will write "infinity" to the size and let PRINT consume
 * it.
 *
 * In this implementation (following the paper, again) the SCAN process is
 * the method called 'pretty_print', and the 'PRINT' process is the method
 * called 'print'.
