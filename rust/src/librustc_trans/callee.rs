        //  * This is a symbol defined in a foreign crate and we're just
        //    monomorphizing in another codegen unit. In this case this symbols
        //    is for sure not exported, so both codegen units will be using
        //    hidden visibility. Hence, we apply a hidden visibility here.
        //
        //  * This is a symbol defined in our local crate. If the symbol in the
        //    other codegen unit is also not exported then like with the foreign
        //    case we apply a hidden visibility. If the symbol is exported from
        //    the foreign object file, however, then we leave this at the
        //    default visibility as we'll just import it naturally.
