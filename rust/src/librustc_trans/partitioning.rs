//! Partitioning Codegen Units for Incremental Compilation
//! ======================================================
//!
//! The task of this module is to take the complete set of translation items of
//! a crate and produce a set of codegen units from it, where a codegen unit
//! is a named set of (translation-item, linkage) pairs. That is, this module
//! decides which translation item appears in which codegen units with which
//! linkage. The following paragraphs describe some of the background on the
//! partitioning scheme.
//!
//! The most important opportunity for saving on compilation time with
//! incremental compilation is to avoid re-translating and re-optimizing code.
//! Since the unit of translation and optimization for LLVM is "modules" or, how
//! we call them "codegen units", the particulars of how much time can be saved
//! by incremental compilation are tightly linked to how the output program is
//! partitioned into these codegen units prior to passing it to LLVM --
//! especially because we have to treat codegen units as opaque entities once
//! they are created: There is no way for us to incrementally update an existing
//! LLVM module and so we have to build any such module from scratch if it was
//! affected by some change in the source code.
//!
//! From that point of view it would make sense to maximize the number of
//! codegen units by, for example, putting each function into its own module.
//! That way only those modules would have to be re-compiled that were actually
//! affected by some change, minimizing the number of functions that could have
//! been re-used but just happened to be located in a module that is
//! re-compiled.
//!
//! However, since LLVM optimization does not work across module boundaries,
//! using such a highly granular partitioning would lead to very slow runtime
//! code since it would effectively prohibit inlining and other inter-procedure
//! optimizations. We want to avoid that as much as possible.
//!
//! Thus we end up with a trade-off: The bigger the codegen units, the better
//! LLVM's optimizer can do its work, but also the smaller the compilation time
//! reduction we get from incremental compilation.
//!
//! Ideally, we would create a partitioning such that there are few big codegen
//! units with few interdependencies between them. For now though, we use the
//! following heuristic to determine the partitioning:
//!
//! - There are two codegen units for every source-level module:
//! - One for "stable", that is non-generic, code
//! - One for more "volatile" code, i.e. monomorphized instances of functions
//!   defined in that module
//! - Code for monomorphized instances of functions from external crates gets
//!   placed into every codegen unit that uses that instance.
//!
//! In order to see why this heuristic makes sense, let's take a look at when a
//! codegen unit can get invalidated:
//!
//! 1. The most straightforward case is when the BODY of a function or global
//! changes. Then any codegen unit containing the code for that item has to be
//! re-compiled. Note that this includes all codegen units where the function
//! has been inlined.
//!
//! 2. The next case is when the SIGNATURE of a function or global changes. In
//! this case, all codegen units containing a REFERENCE to that item have to be
//! re-compiled. This is a superset of case 1.
//!
//! 3. The final and most subtle case is when a REFERENCE to a generic function
//! is added or removed somewhere. Even though the definition of the function
//! might be unchanged, a new REFERENCE might introduce a new monomorphized
//! instance of this function which has to be placed and compiled somewhere.
//! Conversely, when removing a REFERENCE, it might have been the last one with
//! that particular set of generic arguments and thus we have to remove it.
//!
//! From the above we see that just using one codegen unit per source-level
//! module is not such a good idea, since just adding a REFERENCE to some
//! generic item somewhere else would invalidate everything within the module
//! containing the generic item. The heuristic above reduces this detrimental
//! side-effect of references a little by at least not touching the non-generic
//! code of the module.
//!
//! As another optimization, monomorphized functions from external crates get
//! some special handling. Since we assume that the definition of such a
//! function changes rather infrequently compared to local items, we can just
//! instantiate external functions in every codegen unit where it is referenced
//! -- without having to fear that doing this will cause a lot of unnecessary
//! re-compilations. If such a reference is added or removed, the codegen unit
//! has to be re-translated anyway.
//! (Note that this only makes sense if external crates actually don't change
//! frequently. For certain multi-crate projects this might not be a valid
//! assumption).
//!
//! A Note on Inlining
//! ------------------
//! As briefly mentioned above, in order for LLVM to be able to inline a
//! function call, the body of the function has to be available in the LLVM
//! module where the call is made. This has a few consequences for partitioning:
//!
//! - The partitioning algorithm has to take care of placing functions into all
//!   codegen units where they should be available for inlining. It also has to
//!   decide on the correct linkage for these functions.
//!
//! - The partitioning algorithm has to know which functions are likely to get
//!   inlined, so it can distribute function instantiations accordingly. Since
//!   there is no way of knowing for sure which functions LLVM will decide to
//!   inline in the end, we apply a heuristic here: Only functions marked with
//!   #[inline] and (as stated above) functions from external crates are
//!   considered for inlining by the partitioner. The current implementation
//!   will not try to determine if a function is likely to be inlined by looking
//!   at the functions definition.
//!
//! Note though that as a side-effect of creating a codegen units per
//! source-level module, functions from the same module will be available for
//! inlining, even when they are not marked #[inline].
