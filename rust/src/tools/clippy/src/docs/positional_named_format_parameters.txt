### What it does
This lint warns when a named parameter in a format string is used as a positional one.

### Why is this bad?
It may be confused for an assignment and obfuscates which parameter is being used.

### Example
```
println!("{}", x = 10);
```

Use instead:
```
println!("{x}", x = 10);
```
