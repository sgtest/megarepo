### What it does
checks for `Box::new(T::default())`, which is better written as
`Box::<T>::default()`.

### Why is this bad?
First, it's more complex, involving two calls instead of one.
Second, `Box::default()` can be faster
[in certain cases](https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/standard-library-types.html#box).

### Known problems
The lint may miss some cases (e.g. Box::new(String::from(""))).
On the other hand, it will trigger on cases where the `default`
code comes from a macro that does something different based on
e.g. target operating system.

### Example
```
let x: Box<String> = Box::new(Default::default());
```
Use instead:
```
let x: Box<String> = Box::default();
```
