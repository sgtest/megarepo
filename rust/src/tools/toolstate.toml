# This file reflects the current status of all tools which are allowed
# to fail without failing the build.
#
# There are three states a tool can be in:
# 1. Broken: The tool doesn't build
# 2. Building: The tool builds but its tests are failing
# 3. Testing: The tool builds and its tests are passing
#
# In the future there will be further states like "Distributing", which
# configures whether the tool is included in the Rust distribution.
#
# If a tool was working before your PR but is broken now, consider
# opening a PR against the tool so that it works with your changes.
# If the tool stops compiling, change its state to `Broken`. If it
# still builds, change it to `Compiling`.
# How to do that is described in
# "CONTRIBUTING.md#External Dependencies". If the effort required is not
# warranted (e.g. due to the tool abusing some API that you changed, and
# fixing the tool would mean a significant refactoring) remember to ping
# the tool authors, so they can fix it, instead of being surprised by the
# breakage.
#
# Each tool has a list of people to ping

# ping @oli-obk @RalfJung @eddyb
miri = "Broken"

# ping @Manishearth @llogiq @mcarton @oli-obk
clippy = "Broken"

# ping @nrc
rls = "Testing"

# ping @nrc
rustfmt = "Testing"
