error[E0382]: use of moved value: `x`
  --> $DIR/move-consuming-capture.rs:17:9

LL |         let x = async move || {
   |             - move occurs because `x` has type `{coroutine-closure@$DIR/move-consuming-capture.rs:13:17: 13:30}`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
...
LL |         x().await;
   |         --- `x` moved due to this method call
LL |         x().await;
   |         ^ value used here after move

note: `async_call_once` takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `x`
