   = note: for more information, see issue #114447 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/114447>
   = note: reference of mutable static is a hard error from 2024 edition
   = note: mutable statics can be written to by multiple threads: aliasing violations or data races will cause undefined behavior
   = note: `#[warn(static_mut_ref)]` on by default
help: mutable references are dangerous since if there's any other pointer or reference used for that static while the reference lives, that's UB; use `addr_of_mut!` instead to create a raw pointer
