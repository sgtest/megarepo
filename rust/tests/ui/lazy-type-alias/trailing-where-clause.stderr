LL |     let _: Alias<()>;
   |            ^^^^^^^^^ the trait `From<()>` is not implemented for `String`

   = help: the following other types implement trait `From<T>`:
             <String as From<char>>
             <String as From<Box<str>>>
             <String as From<Cow<'a, str>>>
             <String as From<&str>>
             <String as From<&mut str>>
             <String as From<&String>>
note: required by a bound on the type alias `Alias`

LL |     String: From<T>;
   |             ^^^^^^^ required by this bound
