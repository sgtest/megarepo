error[E0596]: cannot borrow `*inner` as mutable, as it is behind a `&` reference
  --> $DIR/issue-91206.rs:14:5
   |
LL |     inner.clear();
   |     ^^^^^ `inner` is a `&` reference, so the data it refers to cannot be borrowed as mutable
   |
help: you can `clone` the `Vec<usize>` value and consume it, but this might not be your desired behavior

LL |     let inner = client.get_inner_ref();
   |                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
help: consider specifying this binding's type
   |
LL |     let inner: &mut Vec<usize> = client.get_inner_ref();
