error[E0277]: can't compare `&[u8; 1]` with `[{integer}; 1]`

LL |     let _ = &[0u8] == [0xAA];
   |                    ^^ no implementation for `&[u8; 1] == [{integer}; 1]`
   |
   = help: the trait `PartialEq<[{integer}; 1]>` is not implemented for `&[u8; 1]`
   = help: the following other types implement trait `PartialEq<Rhs>`:
             <[A; N] as PartialEq<[B; N]>>
             <[A; N] as PartialEq<[B]>>
             <[A; N] as PartialEq<&[B]>>

             <[T] as PartialEq<Vec<U, A>>>
             <[A] as PartialEq<[B]>>
             <[B] as PartialEq<[A; N]>>
             <&[u8] as PartialEq<Bytes>>
           and 4 others
help: convert the array to a `&[u8]` slice instead
