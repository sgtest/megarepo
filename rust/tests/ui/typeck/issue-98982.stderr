note: the function expects a value to always be returned, but loops might run zero times

LL |     for i in 0..0 {
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ this might have zero elements to iterate on
LL |         return i;
   |         -------- if the loop doesn't execute, this value would never get returned
help: return a value for the case when the loop has zero elements to iterate on

LL ~     }
LL ~     /* `i32` value */

help: otherwise consider changing the return type to account for that possibility
