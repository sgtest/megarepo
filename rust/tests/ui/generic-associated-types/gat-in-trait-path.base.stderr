note: for a trait to be "object safe" it needs to allow building a vtable to allow the call to be resolvable dynamically; for more information visit <https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#object-safety>

   = help: consider moving `A` to another trait
   = help: the following types implement the trait, consider defining an enum where each variant holds one of these types, implementing `Foo` for this new enum and using it instead:
             Fooer<T>
             Fooy
