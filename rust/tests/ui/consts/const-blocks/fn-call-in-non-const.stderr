error[E0277]: the trait bound `Bar: Copy` is not satisfied

   = note: required for `Option<Bar>` to implement `Copy`
   = note: the `Copy` trait is required because this value will be copied for each element of the array
   = help: create an inline `const` block, see RFC #2920 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2920> for more information
help: consider annotating `Bar` with `#[derive(Copy)]`
