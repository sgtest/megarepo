   = warning: this was previously accepted by the compiler but is being phased out; it will become a hard error in a future release!
   = note: for more information, see issue #120362 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/120362>
   = note: the traits must be derived, manual `impl`s are not sufficient
   = note: see https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.StructuralPartialEq.html for details
note: the lint level is defined here
