# functions (except for tfrun); use dedicated scripts instead and reference them
# specifically. Use your best judgment to keep the scripts in this directory
# lean and easy to follow. When in doubt, remember that for CI scripts, "keep it
# simple" is MUCH more important than "don't repeat yourself."

# -e: abort script if one command fails
# -u: error if undefined variable used
# -x: log all commands
# -o pipefail: entire command fails if pipe fails. watch out for yes | ...
# -o history: record shell history
# -o allexport: export all functions and variables to be available to subscripts
#               (affects 'source $TFCI')

# "TFCI" may optionally be set to the name of an env-type file with TFCI
# variables in it, OR may be left empty if the user has already exported the
# relevant variables in their environment. Because of 'set -o allexport' above
# (which is equivalent to "set -a"), every variable in the file is exported
# for other files to use.
