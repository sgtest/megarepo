# simple" is MUCH more important than "don't repeat yourself."

# -u: error if undefined variable used
# -x: log all commands

# variables in it, OR may be left empty if the user has already exported the

# (which is equivalent to "set -a"), every variable in the file is exported
# for other files to use.
