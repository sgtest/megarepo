# any.sh has two run modes.
#
# 1. RUN, TEST, OR BUILD BAZEL TARGET(S) WITHIN A TFCI ENVIRONMENT
#    To use:
#       export TFCI=$(realpath ...)
#       export TF_ANY_TARGETS="quoted list of targets, like on the command line"
#       export TF_ANY_MODE="test" or "build" or "run" (default: "test")
#       ./any.sh
#
# 2. RUN ANY OTHER SCRIPT AND ENV WITH NO SIDE EFFECTS (NO UPLOADS)
#    To use:
#       export TFCI=$(realpath ...)
#       export TF_ANY_SCRIPT=$(realpath wheel.sh)
#       ./any.sh
