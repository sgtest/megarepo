# Combine TF public build cache and local disk cache
# macOS does not use the disk cache because it can get pretty big and cause VM
# timeouts. Note that "_push" cache configs write to GCS buckets and require
# authentication. Use "tf_public_macos_cache" or "tf_public_cache" for public
# read-only cache.
# The cache configs are different for MacOS and Linux
