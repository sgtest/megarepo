// As of Go 1.22, the symbols below are found to be pulled via
// linkname in the wild. We provide a push linkname here, to
// keep them accessible with pull linknames.
// This may change in the future. Please do not depend on them
// in new code.

//go:linkname newBufioReader
//go:linkname newBufioWriterSize
//go:linkname putBufioReader
//go:linkname putBufioWriter

// The compiler doesn't allow linknames on methods, for good reasons.
// We use this trick to push linknames of the methods.
// Do not call them in this package.
