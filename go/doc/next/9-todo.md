TODO: Document that range-over-func is enabled (and that GOEXPERIMENT=rangefunc is relevant) in Go 1.23. This note should be moved to an appropriate location in the release notes.

<!-- go.dev/issue/60905, CL 559555 -->
TODO: The new `GOARM64` environment variable needs to be documented. This note should be moved to an appropriate location in the release notes.

<!-- Maybe should be documented? Maybe shouldn't? Someone familiar with the change needs to determine.

CL 359594 ("x/website/_content/ref/mod: document dotless module paths") - resolved go.dev/issue/32819 ("cmd/go: document that module names without dots are reserved") and also mentioned accepted proposal go.dev/issue/37641
CL 570681 ("os: make FindProcess use pidfd on Linux") mentions accepted proposal go.dev/issue/51246 (described as fully implemented in Go 1.22) and NeedsInvestigation continuation issue go.dev/issue/62654.
CL 555075 ("x/tools/go/ssa: support range-over-func") - x/tools CL implements range-over-func support in x/tools/go/ssa for accepted proposal https://go.dev/issue/66601; this particular proposal and change doesn't seem to need a dedicated mention in Go 1.23 release notes but someone more familiar should take another look
