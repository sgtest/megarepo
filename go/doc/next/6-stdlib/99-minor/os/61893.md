On Windows, the mode bits reported by [`os.Lstat`](/pkg/os#Lstat) and [`os.Stat`](/pkg/os#Stat)
for reparse points changed. Mount points no longer have [`os.ModeSymlink`](/pkg/os#ModeSymlink) set,
and reparse points that are not symlinks, Unix sockets, or dedup files now
always have [`os.ModeIrregular`](/pkg/os#ModeIrregular) set.
This behavior is controlled by the `winsymlink` setting.
For Go 1.23, it defaults to `winsymlink=1`.
Previous versions default to `winsymlink=0`.
