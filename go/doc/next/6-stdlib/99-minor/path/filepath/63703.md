On Windows, [`filepath.EvalSymlinks`](/pkg/path/filepath#EvalSymlinks) no longer evaluates
mount points, which was a source of many inconsistencies and bugs.
This behavior is controlled by the `winsymlink` setting.
For Go 1.23, it defaults to `winsymlink=1`.
Previous versions default to `winsymlink=0`.
