The mutex profile for contention on runtime-internal locks now correctly points
to the end of the critical section that caused the delay. This matches the
profile's behavior for contention on `sync.Mutex` values. The
`runtimecontentionstacks` setting for `GODEBUG`, which allowed opting in to Go
1.22's unusual behavior for this part of the profile, is now gone.
