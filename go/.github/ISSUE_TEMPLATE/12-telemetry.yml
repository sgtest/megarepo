      Why is the counter important?
      For example, what new insights will it provide, and how will that information be used?
      If this is about updating existing counters, why is the change necessary?

    label: Proposed Graph Config
    description: |
      Approved telemetry counters are maintained as [Go Telemetry Graph Config](https://golang.org/x/telemetry/internal/graphconfig) records.
      Please draft the record entry for your proposal here.
      If multiple records need to be included, separate them with `---` lines.
      You can check the list of the approved counters and their current configuration in [config.txt](https://go.googlesource.com/telemetry/+/master/internal/configgen/config.txt).
