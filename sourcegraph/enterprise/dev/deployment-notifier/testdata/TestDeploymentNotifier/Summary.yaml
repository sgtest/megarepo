      breaks the dependency between feature flags and a request object.\r\nNow that
      AnonymousUID exists on the actor struct, we don''t need to hold\r\non to the
      request object for the cookie and we can depend purely on the\r\nactor for the
      information we need to populate feature flags. This makes it\r\npossible to
      set feature flags for an overridden actor.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this fixes an
      issue where, if the actor is changed on a\r\ncontext, the feature flags returned
      may still be for the first actor.\r\n\r\nBuilds off #32475\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test

      contexts\" functionality.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  As part of SOC2/GN-104 and SOC2/GN-105
