# Perforce Protections Specification.
#
# SubPath: The root path of the sub-protections table (only used when
# editing a sub-protections table).
#
# Update: The date this specification was last modified (read-only).
#
# Protections:
# Each line contains a protection mode, a group/user indicator, the
# group/user name, client host id and a depot file path pattern.
# A user gets the highest privilege granted on any line.
#
# Mode: The permission level or right being granted or denied. Each
# permission level includes all the permissions above it, except
# for 'review' and 'owner'. Each permission right only includes
# the specific right and not all the lesser rights. Modes
# preceded by '=' are rights; all other modes are levels.
#
# list - users can see names but not contents of files;
# users can see all non-file related metadata
# (clients, users, changelists, jobs, etc.)
#
# read - users can sync, diff, and print files
#
# open - users can add, edit, delete, and integrate files
#
# write - users can submit open files
#
# admin - permits those administrative commands and command
# options that don't affect the server's security
#
# owner - allows access to the 'p4 protect' command, for
# the specified path.
#
# super - allows access to the 'p4 protect' command
#
# review - allows access to the 'p4 review' command; implies
# read access
#
# =read - if this right is denied, users cannot sync, diff,
# or print files
#
# =branch - if this right is denied, users are not permitted
# to use files as a source for 'p4 integrate'
#
# =open - if this right is denied, users cannot open files
# (add, edit, delete, integrate)
#
# =write - if this right is denied, users cannot submit open
# files
#
# readstreamspec - users can display a stream spec with
# with 'p4 stream -o'.
#
# openstreamspec - users can revert, resolve, shelve, or
# open for edit a stream spec
#
# writestreamspec - users can submit or modify a stream
# spec
#
# =readstreamspec - if this right is denied, users cannot
# execute 'p4 stream -o'
#
# =openstreamspec - if this right is denied, users cannot
# revert, resolve, shelve, or open for edit
# a stream spec
#
# =writestreamspec - if this right is denied, users cannot
# submit or modify a stream
#
# Group/User indicator: either 'group' or 'user'.
#
# Name: A Perforce group or user name; may be wildcarded.
#
# Host: The IP address of a client host (IPv6 and IPv4 addresses
# supported); may be wildcarded, or may instead use CIDR syntax,
# e.g. 172.16.0.0/16 would match all IPv4 addresses which
# start with 172.16.
#
# Path: The part of the depot being granted access.
