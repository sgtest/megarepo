// Package compression handles compressing the number of data points that need to be searched for a code insight series.
//
// The purpose is to reduce the extremely large number of search queries that need to run to backfill a historical insight.
//
// An index of commits is used to understand which time frames actually contain changes in a given repository.
// The commit index comes with metadata for each repository that understands the time at which the index was most recently updated.
// It is relevant to understand whether the index can be considered up to date for a repository or not, otherwise
// frames could be filtered out that simply are not yet indexed and otherwise should be queried.
//
// The commit indexer also has the concept of a horizon, that is to say the farthest date at which indices are stored. This horizon
// does not necessarily correspond to the last commit in the repository (the repo could be much older) so the compression must also
// understand this.
//
// At a high level, the algorithm is as follows:
//
// * Given a series of time frames [1....N]:
// * Always include 1 (to establish a baseline at the max horizon so that last observations may be carried)
// * For each remaining frame, check if it has commit metadata that is up to date, and check if it has no commits. If so, throw out the frame
// * Otherwise, keep the frame
