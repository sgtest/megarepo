// ticker wraps the Take() method provided by schedules to return a stream of
// messages indicating when a changeset should be scheduled, in essentially the
// same way a time.Ticker periodically sends messages over a channel. The
// scheduler can optionally ask the ticker to delay the next Take() call if no
// changesets were ready when consuming the last message: this is important to
// avoid a busy-wait loop.
//
// Note that ticker does not check the validity period of the schedule it is
// given; the caller should do this and stop the ticker if the schedule expires
// or the configuration updates.
//
// It is important that the caller calls stop() when the ticker is no longer in
// use, otherwise a goroutine, channel, and probably a rate limiter will be
// leaked.

	//
	// If nil is sent over this channel, an error occurred, and this ticker must
	// be stopped and discarded immediately.
