# Testing SAML with Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) 2.1

Follow all the steps in this document in order.

## Create an Azure VM running Windows Server 2012

1.  Create an Azure VM using the [Windows Server 2012 Datacenter](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.WindowsServer2012Datacenter) image.
    - ⚠ DO NOT use "Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter" (because R2 ships with ADFS 3.0, and this document is about testing ADFS 2.1 specifically).
    - After clicking on the link above (and, if necessary, signing into Azure and setting up a subscription):
      - Select a deployment model: `Resource Manager`
      - Click **Create**.
    - Basics (Page 1)
      - Name: `adfstest`
      - Username: `alice` (any value is OK)
      - Password: choose a strong password (the instance will be Internet-accessible)
      - Resource group: check the box for **Create new** and enter a name of `adfstest-rg` (any value is OK)
      - Leave everything else unchanged.
      - Click **OK**.
    - Size (Page 2)
      - Choose **B2s** (although smaller instances are probably OK).
      - Click **Select**.
    - Settings (Page 3)
      - Leave everything unchanged and click **OK**.
    - Summary (Page 4)
      - Click **Create**.
    - Create a user named `alice` with a secure password.
1.  Configure the firewall so you can access the VM on port 443.
    1.  Open **Settings > Networking** for the VM.
    1.  Click **Add inbound port rule** and create a rule with the following values:
        - Source: `IP Addresses`
        - Source IP addresses/CIDR ranges: `1.2.3.4/32` (where `1.2.3.4` is your external IPv4 address)
        - Destination port ranges: `*`
        - Name: `AllowAllFromMyIP` (any value is OK)
        - Leave all other values unchanged.
        - Click _Add_.
1.  On your own computer, make the Azure VM accessible at the hostname `adfstest.sgdev.org`:
    - In `/etc/hosts`, add an entry `5.6.7.8 adfstest.sgdev.org` (where `5.6.7.8` is the **Public IP** for the Azure VM).
1.  Connect to it using Remote Desktop
    - [Remmina](https://www.remmina.org/wp/) is a good Linux RDP client.

## Add/install the initial set of Active Directory roles

1.  In **Server Manager > Dashboard**, click **(2) Add roles and features**.
1.  Proceed through the "Add Roles and Features Wizard" as follows:
    - Before You Begin (Page 1)

    - Results (Page 5)
      - Wait for completion.
      - Ignore the warning for the "Configure service settings" step that reads "An error occurred during an attempt to modify the directory attributes for the specified service account. ...".
      - Click **Close**.

## Confirm that ADFS SAML metadata accessible

The ADFS SAML service should now be accessible from your computer. Confirm that, and then add the SSL certificate to your computer's certificate trust store.

1.  Confirm that the following command prints a large XML document:

    ```
    curl --insecure https://adfstest.sgdev.org/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml
    ```

    If it fails, ensure that you configured the Azure VM firewall correctly and added the Azure VM's public IP to `/etc/hosts` (see above).

1.  Extract the `adfstest.sgdev.org` SSL certificate to a file:

    ```
    openssl s_client -connect adfstest.sgdev.org:443 -showcerts < /dev/null | openssl x509 > adfstest-cert.crt
    ```

1.  Add `adfstest-cert.crt` to your computer's certificate trust store.
    - Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): `sudo mv adfstest-cert.crt /usr/share/ca-certificates && sudo dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates` and select `ask`, then check the box for `adfstest-cert.crt` and continue.
    - macOS: Use Keychain Access.
1.  Confirm that the SSL certificate is now trusted by your system by rerunning the `curl` command without `--insecure`:

    ```
    curl https://adfstest.sgdev.org/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml
    ```

## Add ADFS as a SAML auth provider to Sourcegraph critical config

1.  Make your Sourcegraph instance externally accessible over HTTPS (e.g., using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com)).

    🎗️ From here on, substitute `https://sourcegraph.example.com` with your instance's actual URL.

1.  Add the following to your Sourcegraph critical configuration:

    ```json
    {
      ...,
      "externalURL": "https://sourcegraph.example.com",
      "auth.providers": [
        {
          "type": "saml",
          "displayName": "Windows Server 2012 ADFS 2.1 SAML (dev)",
          "identityProviderMetadataURL": "https://adfstest.sgdev.org/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    ⚠ Ensure that this SAML auth provider is the only auth provider with a `type` of `saml`.

1.  Confirm there are no error messages in the Sourcegraph logs (for Sourcegraph Data Center, the `sourcegraph-frontend` pod logs). The most likely error message indicating a problem is `Error prefetching SAML service provider metadata.`.

## Add Sourcegraph as an ADFS Relying Party (RP)

1.  In Windows Server's **Server Manager**, open **Tools > AD FS Management**.
1.  In the right sidebar, click the **Add Relying Party Trust...** action.
1.  Proceed through the "Add Relying Party Trust Wizard" as follows:
    - Welcome (Page 1)
      - Click **Start**.
    - Select Data Source (Page 2)
      - Import data about the relying party published online or on a local network: `https://sourcegraph.example.com/.auth/saml/metadata`
    - Specify Display Name (Page 3)
      - Leave everything unchanged and click **Next >**.
    - Choose Issuance Authorization Rules (Page 4)
      - Leave everything unchanged (**Permit all users to access this relying party** is selected) and click **Next >**.
    - Ready to Add Trust (Page 5)

    - Ready to Add Trust (Page 5)
      - Click **Next >**.
    - Finish (Page 6)
      - Check the box for **Open the Edit Claim Rules dialog...**.
      - Click **Close**.
1.  In the "Edit Claim Rules for sourcegraph.example.com" window in the "Issuance Transform Rules" tab, add the 2 following rules.
    - _Send User Info rule:_ Click **Add Rule...** and proceed through the "Add Transform Claim Rule Wizard" as follows:
      - Choose Rule Type (Page 1)
        - Claim rule template: `Send LDAP Attributes as Claims`
        - Click **Next >**.
      - Configure Claim Rule (Page 2)
        - Claim rule name: `Send User Info` (any value is OK)
        - Attribute store: `Active Directory`
        - Mapping of LDAP attributes to outgoing claim types:
        - `E-Mail-Addresses` -> `E-Mail Address`
        - `Display-Name` -> `Name`
        - Click **Finish**.
    - _Email to NameID rule:_ Click **Add Rule...** and proceed through the "Add Transform Claim Rule Wizard" as follows:
      - Choose Rule Type (Page 1)
        - Claim rule template: `Transform an Incoming Claim`
        - Click **Next >**.
      - Configure Claim Rule (Page 2)
        - Claim rule name: `Email to NameID`
        - Incoming claim type: `E-Mail Address`
        - Outgoing claim type: `Name ID`
        - Outgoing name ID format: `Persistent identifier`
        - Select **Pass through all claim values**.
        - Click **Finish**.
1.  Click **OK** to apply the new claim rules and close the window.

## Authenticate to Sourcegraph using ADFS

All configuration is now complete. Let's test that it works.

1.  Visit `https://sourcegraph.example.com`. (If you are already authenticated from before configuring the SAML auth provider, sign out of Sourcegraph.)
1.  When prompted to sign into ADFS, provide the `alice` credentials and continue.
1.  Confirm that you are authenticated to Sourcegraph as `alice`.

✅ Done!
