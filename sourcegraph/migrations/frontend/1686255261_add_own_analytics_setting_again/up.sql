-- This setting was already added in 1685712730. We need to do it again here.
-- The reason is that own_signal_configurations has id with SERIAL type,
-- and the migration adding analytics setting, inserted just the row values
-- hoping ID would be autogenerated.
-- However two rows inserted previously to this table had hardcoded IDs
-- so they did not advance the ID sequence. Therefore the insert in 1685712730
-- generated one of the ID that were hardcoded (since these were 1 and 2),
-- this generated a conflict, and INSERT failed silently due to ON CONFLICT clause.
-- Reinsert in order to advance the sequence.
