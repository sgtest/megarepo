This directory contains database migrations for the frontend Postgres DB.

## Usage

Migrations are handled by the [migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/tree/master/cmd/migrate#installation) tool. Migrations get applied automatically at application startup. The CLI tool can also be used to manually test migrations.

### Add a new migration

**IMPORTANT:** All migrations must be backward-compatible, meaning that the _existing_ version of
the `frontend` command must be able to run against the _new_ (post-migration) version of the schema.

**IMPORTANT:** Your migration should be written in such a way that tolerates writes from
pre-migration versions of Sourcegraph. This is because frontend pods are updated in a rolling
fashion. During the rolling update, there will be both old and new frontend pods. The first updated
pod will migrate the schema atomically, but the remaining old ones may continue to write before they
are terminated.

Run the following:

```
./dev/add_migration.sh MIGRATION_NAME
```

There will be up/down `.sql` migration files created in this directory. Add
SQL statements to these files that will perform the desired
migration. **NOTE**: the migration runner does not use transactions. Use the
explicit transaction blocks added to the migration script template.

```sql
# Enter statements here
```

After adding SQL statements to those files, embed them into the Go code and update the schema doc:

```
./dev/generate.sh
```

or, to only run the DB generate scripts (subset of the command above):

```
go generate ./migrations/
go generate ./internal/db/
```

Verify that the migration is backward-compatible. We currently have no automated testing for this. You need
to ensure that an old version of Sourcegraph, like what is currently deployed on Sourcegraph.com, can continue
to use the DB during a rolling upgrade from the old version to your version.

Some migrations are difficult to do in a single step. For instance, renaming a column, table, or view, or
adding a column with a non-nullable constraint will all break existing code that accesses that table or view.
In order to do such changes you may need to break your changes into several parts separated by a deployment.

For example, a non-nullable column can be added to an existing table with the following steps:

- Add a nullable column to the table
- Update the code to always populate this row on writes
- Deploy to sourcegraph.com
- Add a non-nullable constraint to the table
- Deploy to sourcegraph.com

We have a hard requirement (enforced by CI) that rolling upgrades are always possible on sourcegraph.com. When
possible, this same standard should be kept between minor release versions to ensure a smooth upgrade process
for private instances (although there will be exceptions due to feature velocity and a monthly release cadence).

### Migrating up/down

Up migrations happen automatically on server start-up after running the
generate scripts. They can also be run manually using the migrate CLI:
run `./dev/migrate.sh up` to move forward to the latest migration. Run
`./dev/migrate.sh` for a full list of options.

You can run `./dev/migrate.sh down 1` to rollback the previous migration. If a migration fails and
you need to revert to a previous state `./dev/migrate.sh force` may be helpful. Alternatively use
the `dropdb` and `createdb` commands to wipe your local DB and start from a clean state.

**Note:** if you find that you need to run a down migration, that almost certainly means the
migration was not backward-compatible, and you should fix this before merging the migration into
`master`.

### Running down migrations for customer rollbacks

Running down migrations in a rollback **should NOT** be necessary if all migrations are
backward-compatible.

In case the customer must run a down migration, they will need to do the following steps:

- Roll back Sourcegraph to the previous version. On startup, the frontend pods will log a migration
  warning stating that the schema has been migrated to a newer version. This warning should **NOT**
  indicate that the database is dirty.
- Verify that the schema is not dirty by running the following:
  ```
  kubectl exec $(kubectl get pod -l app=pgsql -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -- psql -U sg -c 'SELECT * FROM schema_migrations'
  ```
  If it is dirty, refer to the section below on "Dirty DB schema".
- Determine the two commits that correspond to the previous and new versions of Sourcegraph. Check
  out each commit and run `ls -1` in the `migrations` directory. The order of the migrations is the
  same as the alphabetical order of the migration scripts, so take the diff between the two `ls -1`s to determine which migrations should be run.
- Apply the down migration scripts in **reverse chronological order**. Wrap each down migration in a
  transaction block. If there are any errors, stop and resolve the issue before proceeding with the
  next down migration.
- After all down migrations have been applied, run `update schema_migrations set version=$VERSION;`,
  where `$VERSION` is the numerical prefix of the migration script corresponding to the first
  migration you _didn't_ just apply. In other words, it is the numerical prefix of the last
  migration script as of the rolled-back-to commit.
- Restart frontend frontend pods. On restart, they should spin up successfully.

#### Dirty DB schema

If the schema is dirty, that means the current migration (the one indicated in the
`schema_migrations` table) failed midway through. This should almost never happen. If it does
happen, it probably means up/down migrations were applied out of order or other manual changes were
made to the DB that conflict with the current migration stage.

If the schema is dirty, do the following:

- Figure out what change was made to cause the migration to fail midway through.
- Run the necessary SQL commands to make the schema consistent with some version `$VERSION` of the
  schema. `$VERSION` is the numerical prefix of the last up migration script run to produce this
  version of the schema.
- Run `update schema_migrations set version=$VERSION, dirty=false;`
- Restart frontend pods.
