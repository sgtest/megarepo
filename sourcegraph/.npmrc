# Disabling pnpm [hoisting](https://pnpm.io/npmrc#hoist) by setting `hoist=false` is recommended on
# projects using rules_js so that pnpm outside of Bazel lays out a node_modules tree similar to what
# rules_js lays out under Bazel (without a hidden node_modules/.pnpm/node_modules)
hoist=false

# npm_translate_lock with the yarn.lock file will complain about missing/incorrect peer dependencies.
# Temporarily ignore warnings until we switch to pnpm and can user pnpm.packageExtensions to fix them.
