# IMPORTANT: Alpine by default does not come with some packages that are needed
# for working DNS to other containers on a user-defined Docker network. Without
# installing this package, nslookup, Go binaries, etc. will fail to contact
# other Docker containers.
# See https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/issues/1
