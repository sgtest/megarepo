# This federates metrics from the worker container for pure docker and docker-compose
# environments. These are not necessary in k8s environments as federation is handled
# in their config map dynamically with k8s service discovery.
#
# This is a temporary patch over having multiple node processes run in the same
# container to achieve concurrency and can be removed once we rewrite the concurrency
# control part of the precise code intel worker in Go to leverage application-level
# concurrency control.
