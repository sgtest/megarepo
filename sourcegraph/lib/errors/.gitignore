# Generated by rapid after finding counter-examples.
#
# When re-running tests locally during development,
# this enables faster failure finding.

#
# During development, if a check fails, it makes sense
# to disable or refine the check, and add specific,
# minimal tests using the counter-examples found by rapid.
