// Package contract implements configuration and helpers based on environment
// variables expected to be provided by MSP infrastructure (the 'MSP contract').
// It generally has provisions for local development built-in, typically toggled
// by the 'MSP=false' environment variable.
//
// Service implementors should generally default to implementing interfaces
// expected by lib/managedservicesplatform/runtime instead of using package-level
// constructors provided by this package - these are exported only for programs
// that haven't yet, or can't, migrate to the runtime package.
//
// Simple example usage if you need to integrate the contract package directly:
//
//	// Parse the environment into an Env instance.
//	e, _ := contract.ParseEnv([]string{"MSP=true"})
//
//	// Extract Contract instance from Env configuration.
//	c := contract.New(logger, service, e)
//
//	// Also load other custom configuration here from Env you want here
//
//	// Check for errors on Env retrieval (missing/invalid values, etc.)
//	if err := e.Validate(); err != nil { ... }
//
//	// Use Contract helpers and configuration values
//	writer, _ := c.BigQuery.GetTableWriter(ctx, "my-table")
//	writer.Write(...)
//

// Contract loads standardized MSP-provisioned (Managed Services Platform)
// configuration. Most configuration is sourced from environment variables -
// refer to each "sub-contract"'s docstrings for more details. All environment
// variables referenced as part of the MSP contract, including whether they
// are required or not and their defaults, are reported when running a service
// using the MSP runtime with the '-help' flag.
//
// The "sub-contract" types (e.g. Contract.PostgreSQL's type being the private
// postgreSQLContract) are intentionally unavailable to callers, despite being
// exported on Contract. This is intentional: callers should not be passing
// around the sub-contract types directly, as they are implementation details.
// Instead, prefer to create your own parameterizations or create useful types
// (for example, open a PostgreSQL connection), and pass that around instead.
// Even though these types are not exported, their respective exported methods
// and properties are.
//
// For help with the Contract type, and the contract package in general, please
// refer to the package docs or reach out to #discuss-core-services directly.
