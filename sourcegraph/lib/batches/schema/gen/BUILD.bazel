# This target is used by //lib/batches/schema:generate_stringdata_code
# to generate code based on json schemas found in schema/
#
# The reason that this is in it's own folder is to make it easier to invoke
# from Bazel, otherwise the `//go:build +ignore` directive makes that Bazel
# can't invoke this binary. Consequently it is very difficult to use `go run`
# within Bazel as you would have to set GOCACHE, HOME dirs etc - so moving it
# to it's own package side steps some unneeded complexity
