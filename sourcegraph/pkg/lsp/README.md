# lsp

Package lsp contains Go types for the messages used in the Language Server
Protocol.

See
https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/master/protocol.md
for more information.

This was copied from the
[go-langserver](https://github.com/sourcegraph/go-langserver) repository. The
authoritive version of these structs is the LSP spec.
