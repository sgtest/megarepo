# Sourcegraph extension API types for client applications

Extensions should use the `sourcegraph` package, not this package. This package is only for client applications
that embed Sourcegraph extensions and need to communicate with them.

See [Sourcegraph extensions documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/extensions) for more information.
