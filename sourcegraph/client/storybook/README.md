# Storybook configuration

Check out the [Storybook section](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/background-information/web/web_app#storybook) in the [Developing the Sourcegraph web app](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/background-information/web/web_app) docs.

## Usage

Storybook configuration is setup as a `yarn workspace` symlink.

Important commands are exposed via root `package.json`:

```sh
yarn storybook
yarn build-storybook
```

## Environment variables

```sh
# Load only a subset of stories to boost build performance.
STORIES_GLOB=client/web/src/**/*.story.tsx yarn start

# Enable `webpack-bundle-analyzer` plugin.
WEBPACK_BUNDLE_ANALYZER=true yarn start

# Enable `speed-measure-webpack-plugin` plugin.
WEBPACK_SPEED_ANALYZER=true yarn start

# Enable `webpack-dll-plugin`.
WEBPACK_DLL_PLUGIN=true yarn start

# Enabled `webpack-progress-plugin`.
WEBPACK_PROGRESS_PLUGIN=true yarn start

# Enable minification and Webpack config production mode.
MINIFY=true yarn build
```

## DLL Plugin

The [DLL Plugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/dll-plugin/) is used to move most third-party dependencies into a separate pre-built bundle to speed up development build. To start Storybook development server with DLL Plugin enabled run: `yarn start:dll` from the Storybook workspace or `yarn storybook:dll` from the root folder.

### How `yarn start:dll` works

1. `DllReferencePlugin` is enabled in the Storybook configuration via the `WEBPACK_DLL_PLUGIN` environment variable.
2. If the DLL manifest is not available at `./assets/dll-bundle/dll-plugin.manifest.json`, the `yarn build:dll-bundle` command is executed to create a DLL bundle.
3. The list of third-party dependencies from Webpack stats is required to create a DLL bundle. If Webpack stats are not available at `./storybook-static/preview-stats.json`, the `yarn build:webpack-stats` command is executed to create them.
4. Webpack stats are generated from `storybook-start --webpack-stats-json` command.
5. DLL bundle is built using Webpack config `./src/webpack.config.dll.ts`.
6. `DllReferencePlugin` is initialized using just created DLL manifest.
7. Storybook development server starts ðŸŽ‰.

If DLL bundle and Webpack stats are in place, all intermediate steps are skipped straight to the start of Storybook development server.
