- See below for documentation on state management.
  - One state machine that lives in Core
- See './contract.ts' to see the APIs for the three main components:
  - Core, search sidebar, and search panel.
  - The extension host API is exposed through the search sidebar.
- See './webview/comlink' for documentation on _how_ communication between contexts works.
  - It is _not_ important to understand this layer to add features to the VS Code extension (that's why it exists, after all).

## State Management

This extension runs code in 4 (and counting) different execution contexts.
Coordinating state between these contexts is a difficult task. So, instead of managing shared state in each context, we maintain one state machine in the "Core" context (see above for architecure diagram).
All contexts listen for state updates and emit events on which the state machine may transition.

For example:

- Commands from VS Code extension core
- The first submitted search in a session will cause the state machine to transition from the `search-home` state to the `search-results` state.
- This new state will be reflected in both the search sidebar and search panel UIs

We represent a hierarchical state machine in a "flat" manner to reduce code complexity and because our state machine is simple enough to not necessitate bringing in a library.

```
┌───►home
│
search
│
└───►results
```

- remote-browsing
- idle
- context-invalidated
  becomes:
- [search-home, search-results, remote-browsing, idle, context-invalidated]

Example user flow state transitions:

- User clicks on Sourcegraph logo in VS Code sidebar.
- Extension activates with initial state of `search-home`
- User submits search -> state === `search-results`
- User clicks on a search result, which opens a file -> state === `remote-browsing`
- User copies some code, then focuses an editor for a local file -> state === `idle`

## Development

### Build and Run

#### Desktop and Web Version

1. `git clone` the [Sourcegraph repository](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph)
1. Install dependencies via `yarn` for the Sourcegraph repository
1. Run `yarn generate` at the root directory to generate the required schemas
1. Make your changes to the files within the `client/vscode` directory with VS Code
1. Run `yarn build-vsce` to build or `yarn watch-vsce` to build and watch the tasks from the `root` directory
1. Select `Launch VS Code Extension` (`Launch VS Code Web Extension` for VS Code Web) from the dropdown menu in the `Run and Debug` sidebar view to see your changes

### Integration Tests

To perform integration tests:

1. In the Sourcegraph repository:
   1. `yarn`
   2. `yarn generate`
2. In the `client/vscode` directory:
   1. `yarn build:test` or `yarn watch:test`
   2. `yarn test-integration`

## GitPod

The Sourcegraph extension for VS Code also works on GitPod.

#### Desktop Version

To install this extension on GitPod Desktop:

1. Open the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of your workspace
2. Search for `Sourcegraph`
3. Click `install` to install the Sourcegraph extension

#### Web Version

To run and test the web extension on GitPod Web (as well as VS Code and GitHub for the web), you must sideload the extension from your local machine as suggested in the following steps:

1. `git clone` the [Sourcegraph repository](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph)
1. Run `yarn && yarn generate` at the root directory to install dependencies and generate the required schemas
1. Run `yarn build-vsce` at root to build the Sourcegraph VS Code extension for Web
1. Once the build has been completed, move to the extension’s directory: `cd client/vscode`
1. Start an HTTP server inside the extension’s path to host the extension locally: `npx serve --cors -l 8988`
1. In another terminal, generate a publicly-accessible URL from your locally running HTTP server using the localtunnel tool: `npx localtunnel -p 8988`
   1. A publicly-accessible URL will be generated for you in the output followed by “your url is:”
1. Copy and then open the newly generated URL in a browser and then select “Click to Continue”
1. Open the Command Palette in GitPod Web (a GitPod Workspace using the Open in Browser setting)
1. Select “Developer: Install Web Extension…”
1. Paste the newly generated URL in the input area and select Install
1. The extension is now installed

## Release Process

The release process for the VS Code Extension for Sourcegraph is currently automated.

#### Prerequisite

- Install the [VSCE CLI tool](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#vsce)

#### Release Steps

1. Create a new branch when the main branch is ready for release, or use your current working branch if it is ready for release
2. Run `yarn --cwd client/vscode release:$RELEASE_TYPE` in the root directory
   - $RELEASE_TYPE: major, minor, patch, pre
     - Example: `yarn --cwd client/vscode release:patch`
   - This command will:
     - Update the package.json file with the next version number
     - Update the changelog format by listing everything under `Unreleased` to the updated version number
     - Make a commit for the release and push to the current branch
3. Open a PR to merge the current branch into main
4. Once the main branch has the updated version number and changelog, run `git push origin main:vsce/release`
   - This will trigger the build pipeline for publishing the extension using the `yarn release` command
   - Publish release to [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.sourcegraph)
   - Publish release to [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/sourcegraph/sourcegraph)
   - The extension will be published with the correct package name via the [vsce CLI tool](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#vsce)
5. Visit the [buildkite page for the vsce/release pipeline](https://buildkite.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/builds?branch=vsce%2Frelease) to watch the build process

Once the build is completed with no error, you should see the new version being verified for the Sourcegraph extension in:

- VS Code Marketplace: [Marketplace Publisher Dashboard](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers)
- Open VSX Registry: [Namespaces Tab in User Settings](https://open-vsx.org/user-settings/namespaces)

> NOTE: It might take up to 10 minutes before the new release is published.
