Sourcegraph’s code search allows you to find & fix things fast across all your code.

Sourcegraph for VS Code allows you to search millions of open source repositories right from your VS Code IDE—for free. You can learn from helpful code examples, search best practices, and re-use code from millions of repositories across the open source universe.

Sourcegraph’s Code Intelligence feature provides fast, cross-repository navigation with “Go to definition” and “Find references” features, allowing you to understand new code quickly and find answers in your code across codebases of any size.

You can read more about Sourcegraph on our [website](https://about.sourcegraph.com/).

## Installation

### From the Visual Studio Marketplace:

1. Install Sourcegraph from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.sourcegraph).
2. Launch VS Code, and click on the Sourcegraph (Wildcard) icon in the VS Code Activity Bar to open the Sourcegraph extension. Alternatively, you can launch the extension by pressing <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> and searching for “Sourcegraph: Open search tab.”

### From within VS Code:

1. Open the extensions tab on the left side of VS Code (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>).
2. Search for `Sourcegraph` -> `Install` and `Reload`.

### From Gitpod VS Code Workspaces:

1. Open the `Extensions view` by clicking on the Extensions icon in the [Activity Bar](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/ux-guidelines/overview#activity-bar) on the side of your Gitpod VS Code workspace
2. Search for [Sourcegraph](https://open-vsx.org/extension/sourcegraph/sourcegraph) -> `Install` and `Reload`.

## Using the Sourcegraph extension

To get started and open the Sourcegraph extension, simply click the Sourcegraph (Wildcard) icon in the VS Code Activity Bar.

Sourcegraph functions like any search engine; simply type in your search query, and Sourcegraph will populate search results.

Learn more about Sourcegraph search in our [docs](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search).

For example, you can search for "auth provider" in a Go repository with a search like this one:

```
repo:sourcegraph/sourcegraph lang:go auth provider
```

## Adding and searching your own code

### Creating an account

In addition to searching open source code, you can create a Sourcegraph account to search your own private and public repositories. You can create an account and sync your repositories with the following steps:

1. Click the `Create an account` button in the sidebar of the Sourcegraph extension. You will be directed to sourcegraph.com in your browser.
2. Follow the instructions to create and configure your Sourcegraph instance

### Connecting to your Sourcegraph instance

1.  In Sourcegraph, in your account settings, navigate to `Access tokens`, then click `Generate new token`.
2.  Once you have generated a token, navigate to your VS Code Settings, then navigate to "Extension settings".
3.  Navigate to `Code preferences`, then click `Settings`.
4.  Search for `Sourcegraph`, and enter the newly generated access token as well as your Sourcegraph instance URL.
5.  Add custom headers using the `sourcegraph.requestHeaders` setting (added in v2.0.9) if a specific header is required to make connection to your private instance.

### Adding it to your workspace's recommended extensions

1. Create a `.vscode` folder (if not already present) in the root of your repository
2. Inside that folder, create a new file named `extensions.json` (if it doesn't already exist) with the following structure.

```
{
	"recommendations": ["sourcegraph.sourcegraph"]
}
```

3. If the file does exist, append `"sourcegraph.sourcegraph"` to the `"recommendations"` array.
4. Push the changes to your repository for your other colleagues to share.

Alternatively you can use the `Extensions: Configure Recommended Extensions (Workspace Folder)` command from within VS Code.
