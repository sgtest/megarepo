// Sourcegraph VS Code extension Comlink "communication layer" documentation
// -----
// NOTE: This is a working work-in-progress. We should be able to swap out this
// "communication layer" with either our own VS Code webview RPC solution
// or by applying this adapter to a fork of Comlink.

// MOTIVATION:
// Comlink is a great library that makes it easy to work with Web Workers: https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/comlink.
// We use it to implement a bi-directional communication channel between our web application/browser extension and
// our Sourcegraph extension host. Given the need to sync state between {search panel <- extension "Core" -> search webview},
// Comlink was a natural fit. However, we needed to implement some hacky adapters to get it to work for our needs:

// web <-> web: Default Comlink use case. Depends on ability to transfer `MessageChannel`s, which
// is built into browsers.
// web <-> node: Cannot transfer `MessageChannel`s between VS Code webviews and Node.js extension "Core",
//  so we have to hijack Comlink's Proxy transfer handler to manage nested Proxied objects ourselves.
//  Since the transfer handler registry is global, a web context that needs to communicate with Node.js will
//  have pushed out the default Proxy transfer handler out and therefore needs to manage web to web messages as well.

// Consequently, there are three endpoint generators (all return endpoints for both directions):
// - extension <-> webview (extension context)
// - web <-> extension (webview context)
// - web <-> web (webview context, used for Sourcegraph extension host Web Worker)
