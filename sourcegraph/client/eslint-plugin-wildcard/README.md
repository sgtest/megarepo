# eslint-plugin-wildcard

Recommended ESLint rules for consumers of the Wildcard component library.

## Setup

Update your `.eslintrc` file to add the following configuration:

```js
  plugins: ['@sourcegraph/wildcard'],
  extends: ['plugin:@sourcegraph/wildcard/recommended'],
```

This will enable the plugin in your project and enforce our recommended rules.
