/**
 * Purpose of this script: create a source code zip that can be used shared and
 * used to produce a build of the browser extensions.
 *
 * This makes it possible to provide the complete source code to the maintainers
 * of extension registries, in the cases where providing the source code is a
 * pre-requisite to getting approval for publishing.
 *
 * This script fetches a fresh copy of the repository, identified by commit ID,
 * instead of zipping the current working directory. This is done instead for
 * these reasons:
 *
 * - To avoid zipping any changes in the current tree, or any existing build
 * artifacts.
 *
 * - To be able to exclude some unnecessary directories by deleting them before
 * zipping.
