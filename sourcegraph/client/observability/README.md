# Observability

Shared client infrastructure observability tools.

## Vision

1. Use this package for new scripts related to client infrastructure instrumentation and analysis.
2. Colocate logic here to benefit from having shared:
   - setup configuration (libhoney.js),
   - observability event schemas,
   - environment variable validators,
   - unit tests.
