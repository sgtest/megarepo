# Sourcegraph Backstage Frontend (WIP)

Welcome to the Sourcegraph Backstage Frontend plugin!

_This plugin was created through the Backstage CLI_

## NOTE

This plugin is still very much in development as is a work in progress. For any questions please ask in #job-fair-backstage or dm @William Bezuidenhout

## Getting started

Your plugin has been added to the example app in this repository, meaning you'll be able to access it by running `yarn start` in the root directory, and then navigating to [/sourcegraph](http://localhost:3000/sourcegraph).

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](./dev) directory.
