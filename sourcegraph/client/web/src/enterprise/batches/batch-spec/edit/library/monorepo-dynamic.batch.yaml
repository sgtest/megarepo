  Create one changeset per workspace in the sourcegraph frontend monorepo
  Workspaces are set where some file is present, eg. package.json in this example
on:
  - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph


# Each time a package.json is found at a path, batch change will treat it as a workspace
workspaces:
  - rootAtLocationOf: package.json
    in: "*"

# Batch change steps will run in each workspace
steps:
  - run: |
      if [[ $(pwd) = "/work" ]]; then
        echo "This is the root workspace, skipping"
      else
        echo "I'm running in $PWD" > hello-world.md
      fi
    container: alpine:3
