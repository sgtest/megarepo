        WebAssembly (sometimes abbreviated Wasm) is an open standard that defines a portable binary-code format for
        executable programs, and a corresponding textual assembly language, as well as interfaces for facilitating
        interactions between such programs and their host environment. The main goal of WebAssembly is to enable
        high-performance applications on web pages, but the format is designed to be executed and integrated in other
        environments as well, including standalone ones.
