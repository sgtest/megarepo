# Linked reference results test data

This generates a repository `main` that produces linked reference results that occur when implementing methods from an interface or base class.

The generated LSIF data covers a regression of a mission feature where the LSIF correlator would not correctly link `item` edges between two reference results (previously, it only correctly linked a reference result and a range or result set).
