# LSIF code intelligence

This project is an early adopter of Microsoft's [LSIF](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2019/02/19/lsif) standard. LSIF (Language Server Index Format) is a format used to store the results of language server queries that are computed ahead-of-time. We uses this format to provide jump-to-definition, find-reference, and hover docstring functionality.

LSIF dumps are generated by running an LSIF indexer in a build or continuous integration environment. The dump is uploaded to a Sourcegraph instance via [Sourcegraph CLI](https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli). An LSIF API server, proxied by the frontend for auth, answers relevant LSP queries to provide fast and precise code intelligence.

### Architecture

This project is split into three parts, all currently written in TypeScript. These parts are deployable independently but can also run in the same docker container to simplify deployment with docker-compose.

- The [API server](./src/api-server/api.ts) receives LSIF uploads and answers LSP queries via HTTP.
- The [bundle-manager](./src/bundle-manager/manager.ts) answers queries about a particular upload by looking at relevant SQLite databases on-disk.
- The [worker](./src/worker/worker.ts) dequeues unconverted LSIF uploads from Postgres and converts them into SQLite databases that can be queried by the server.

### Entrypoint

The docker image for this part of the application is produced by [./cmd/lsif-server](../), which wraps a server, a bundle manager, and a worker with a supervisor.

### Documentation

- Usage documentation is provided on [Sourcegraph.com](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/user/code_intelligence/lsif).
- API endpoint documentation is provided in [api.md](./docs/api.md).
- Database configuration and migrations are described in [database.md](./docs/database.md).
