# telemetry-gateway

Telemetry Gateway is a managed service that ingests events exported from Sourcegraph instances, manipulates them as needed, and exports them to designated Pub/Sub topics or other destinations for processing.

Refer to [the Telemetry Gateway development documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/how-to/telemetry_gateway) for more development guidance.
