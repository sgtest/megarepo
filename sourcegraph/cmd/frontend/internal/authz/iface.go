// AuthzProvider defines a source of truth of which repositories a user is authorized to view. The

// following:
//
// * Code host
// * LDAP groups
// * SAML identity provider (via SAML group permissions)
//
// In most cases, an authz provider represents a code host, because it is the source of truth for
// repository permissions.

	// identifies the user to the authz source (e.g., the code host). The return value is a map of
	// repository permissions. If a repo in the input set is missing from the returned permissions
	// map, that means "no permissions" on that repo.
	//
	// Implementations should handle any external account whose ServiceID and ServiceType values
	// match the `ServiceID()` and `ServiceType()` return values of this authz provider. The caller
	// can call the `FetchAccount` method to compute such an account from existing accounts. (Note:
	// implementations should use only the userAccount parameter to compute permissions. They should
	// NOT use any information about the currently authenticated user, including what might be
	// inferred from the ctx parameter.) The userAccount parameter may be nil, in which case the set
	// of permissions for an code-host-unauthenticated user is returned.
	//
	// Design note: this is a better interface than ListAllRepos, because the list of all repos may
	// be very long (especially if the returned list includes public repos). RepoPerms is a
	// sufficient interface for all current use cases and leaves up to the implementation which repo
	// permissions it needs to compute.  In practice, most will probably use a combination of (1)
	// "list all private repos the user has access to", (2) a mechanism to determine which repos are
	// public/private, and (3) a cache of some sort.

	//
	// Implementations should use only the `user` and `current` parameters to compute the returned
	// external account. Specifically, they should not try to get the currently authenticated user
	// from the context parameter.

	// The `user` argument should always be non-nil. If no external account can be computed for the
	// provided user, implementations should return nil, nil.
