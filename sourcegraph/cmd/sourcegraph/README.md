# Single-program distribution (dev only)

Run `sg start single-program-experimental-blame-sqs` to run Sourcegraph locally with some services. This can be faster than `sg start`, which runs more services and compiles/runs them each individually.

Use at your own risk, and blame @sqs if this has any problems.

**Status:** only for local dev
