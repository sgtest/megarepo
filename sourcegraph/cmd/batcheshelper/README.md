### pre

The `pre` mode prepares the workspace for the Batch Change step to be executed. This includes,

- Setting up Environment Variables
- Evaluating step condition
- Writing File Mounts
- Writing Workspace Files

#### Example Command

```shell
batcheshelper pre 0
```

### post

The `post` mode determines the changes that were made to the workspace by the Batch Change step. The mode will,

- Generate a `git` diff
- Write the Batch Change step logs to a result file
- Generate a Cache Key

#### Example Command

```shell
batcheshelper pre 0
```

## Build

When running on Kubernetes, the image can be built with the following command.

```shell
IMAGE=sourcegraph/batcheshelper:insiders ./build.sh
```

When running the following `sg` commands, `batcheshelper` will automatically be built on any changes to the binary.

- `batcheshelper-builder`
- `batches`
