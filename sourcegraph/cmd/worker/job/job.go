	// configuration (and all configuration errors should be surfaced via Validate).

	// Note that the given context is meant to be used _only_ for setup. A context
	// passed to a periodic routine should be a fresh context unattached to this,
	// as the argument to this function will be canceled after all Routine invocations
	// have exited after application startup.
