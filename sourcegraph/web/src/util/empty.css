/*
This CSS file is intentionally empty in development mode.

In production mode, we use https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin to extract CSS
to a separate CSS file for better caching and faster client rendering.

In development, we do NOT use mini-css-extract-plugin because it slows down Webpack (initial builds
by ~5s and incremental reloads by ~2s). To avoid the browser console log reporting noisy 404s, this
empty file is used as the Webpack style entrypoint.
