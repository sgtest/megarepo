                    Sourcegraph periodically sends a ping to Sourcegraph.com to help our product and customer teams. It
                    sends only the high-level data below. It never sends code, repository names, usernames, or any other
                    specific data.

                <h3>Critical telemetry</h3>
                <p>
                    Critical telemetry includes only the high-level data below required for billing, support, updates,
                    and security notices. This cannot be disabled.
