# Integration tests

This file contains integration tests for the Sourcegraph UI.

The role of these integration tests is to provide in-browser testing of complex UI flows in isolation from the Sourcegraph backend. They are built on top of Puppeteer & Mocha.

These tests are declared using the helpers declared in [`helpers.ts`](./helpers.ts), which wrap Mocha helpers and provide a similar API.

Mocked data for the tests is generated by running them with a real backend, with the `RECORD` environment variable set to a truthy value:

```
env RECORD=true yarn test-integration
```

Responses will be intercepted and saved as JSON in the `__fixtures__` directory.

When running the tests, static JS/CSS assets will be served from the `ui/assets` directory. Other requests will be intercepted, and responded to using fixture data.

Before running tests, call `yarn build` to make sure to have up-to-date assets.
