// Remove focus ring around nav links during mousedown.
//
// The focus ring on nav links is usually undesirable. It shows up when you click on a nav link and remains until
// you click elsewhere. Because many of our nav links are toolbar buttons, this means that (1) the focus ring
// remains visible even when it is not useful anymore (after you've clicked the button) and (2) the focus ring is
// chopped off on the top and bottom by the toolbar boundaries.
//
// But the focus ring is important when using the keyboard to focus and for accessibility. In the future, the CSS
// :focus-visible pseudo-selector will solve our problems (and we could consider using the polyfill
// https://github.com/wicg/focus-visible).
//
// For now, we only remove the focus ring during mousedown. This lets elements that want to eliminate the focus
// ring for mouse focus (without affecting it for keyboard focus or a11y) do so by calling HTMLElement#blur in an
// onclick handler.
