#
# - Runs postgres under ~/.sourcegraph with a unix socket. No need to manage a
#   service. Must remember to run "pg_ctl stop" if you want to stop it.
# - Builds bazel statically (on linux) and configures it to use toolchains for nodejs
#   and rust to use the ones provided by rules_nixpkgs
#
# Status: everything works on linux & darwin.
