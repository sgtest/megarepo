# We use Alpine, and Alpine packages only keep the most recent few releases of packages,
# with older releases being dropped on a regular basis. This means pinning versions as
# enforced in https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/wiki/DL3018 causing frequent build
# failures due to missing packages or mismatched inter-package dependencies, at which
# point we just upgrade anyway, negating the use for pinning packages. There are no build
# reproducibility advantages either since we cannot rebuild an image if a package version
# required is no longer available.
#
# To force the inclusion of a security patch, use 'package>=$version' instead of pinning.
