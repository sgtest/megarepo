# Dev auth provider

[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org) is an authentication provider that we use in development to test Sourcegraph's support for OpenID Connect and SAML. It serves the same role as OpenID Connect and SAML providers on Okta, OneLogin, Google Workspace, etc., but it runs locally and is easier to autoconfigure for use with your local dev server.

## Using Keycloak in local dev

Keycloak is **not** started by default when you run `dev/start.sh`.

To enable it, use `USE_KEYCLOAK=1 dev/start.sh`.

To use it, visit your local dev server's sign-in page and authenticate using an auth provider whose name contains "Keycloak".

### Configuring Keycloak, adding users, etc.

If you need to edit client or user information and want to persist your changes:

1.  Start Keycloak, if you haven't already. See the above section for steps. The `keycloak` Docker container should be running.
1.  Edit the JSON files in `config/` as needed.
1.  Run `RESET=1 scripts/configure-keycloak.sh` to clobber the existing configuration with the `config/*.json` files' configuration.

Not sure how to edit the JSON to achieve your desired outcome? Use the Keycloak admin interface at http://localhost:3220/auth (login as `root`/`q`) to change configuration, and then export to JSON.
