"""Database schema backward compatibility definitions.

Clones and patches Sourcegraph git repository under @sourcegraph_back_compat so we can run tests targets
from that particular release against the new database schema.

Flakes can be defined to skip known problematic tests which are either flaky or simply cannot run against
the new schema in case of a breaking change. See //dev/backcompat:flakes.bzl for more details about
how to define them.

The final result is the definition of a @sourcegraph_back_compat target, whose test targets are exactly
the same as back then, but with instead a new schema.

Example: `bazel test @sourcegraph_back_compat//enterprise/internal/batches/...`.

See https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+dev/backcompat/patches/back_compat_migrations.patch+repo:github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph+lang:Go&patternType=standard&sm=0&groupBy=repo
for the command generating the mandatory patch file in CI for these tests to run.

If the patch file were to be missing, a placeholder diff is in place to make it explicit (in the
eventuality of someone running those locally).

    # internal libraries from github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/lib and their
    # respective go_repository rules are annoted with build directives for Gazelle
    # that fixes package resolution.
    #
    # When we're cloning the git repository of sourcegraph/sourcegraph on the release version
    # we're testing against, those directives are not working as intended, as they appear to be
    # evaluate target resolution in the global scope instead of @sourcegraph_back_compat, leading
    # to compiling these two packages with the right targets, but linking them against the ones
    # from our root workspace.

    # @sourcegraph_back_compat declares, but we rewrite the directives to resolve toward
    # @sourcegraph_back_compat explicitly. The version/sum are exactly the same ones as defined
    # by @sourcegraph_back_compat on the commit tagged by the release.
