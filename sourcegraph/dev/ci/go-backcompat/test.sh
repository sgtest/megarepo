This commit contains database schema definitions that caused an unexpected
failure of one or more unit tests at tagged commit \`${latest_minor_release_tag}\`.
Rewrite these schema changes to be backwards compatible. For help,
see [the migrations guide](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/background-information/sql/migrations).

If this backwards incompatibility is intentional or if the test is flaky,
an exception for this test can be added to the following flakefile:

\`\`\`
${flakefile}
\`\`\`

⚠️ If by the time you are adding an exception, the release has already been cut, but it has not
been published yet, the best course of action is to postpone merging the commit creating the issue
until the release process is complete.
