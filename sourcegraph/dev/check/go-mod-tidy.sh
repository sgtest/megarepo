go mod tidy

# Check if git diff contains go.mod and/or go.sum. In case the diff does not contain either of these files, `grep -c` will return a non-zero exit code leading to this script exiting as we `set -e` above. To avoid this, when `grep -c` returns no matches and fails we execute `true` to avoid a premature non-zero exit code. Detailed explanation is here:

  echo 'ERROR: go mod tidy generated a diff in go.mod and/or go.sum. Please run "go mod tidy" and commit the changes'
