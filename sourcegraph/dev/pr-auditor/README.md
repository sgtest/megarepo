`pr-auditor` is a tool designed to operate on some [GitHub Actions pull request events](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request) in order to check for SOC2 compliance.
Owned by the [DevX team](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/product-engineering/engineering/enablement/dev-experience).

## Usage

This action is primarily designed to run on GitHub Actions, and leverages the [pull request event payloads](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request) extensively.

The optional `-protected-branch` flag defines a base branch that always opens a PR audit issue to track all pull requests made to it.

```sh
GITHUB_EVENT_PATH="/path/to/json/payload.json"
GITHUB_TOKEN="personal-access-token"

# run directly
go run ./dev/pr-auditor/ check \
  -github.payload-path="$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH" \
  -github.token="$GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -protected-branch="release"

# run using wrapper script
./dev/buildchecker/check-pr.sh
```

## Deployment

`pr-auditor` can be deployed to repositories using the available [batch changes](./batch-changes/README.md).
