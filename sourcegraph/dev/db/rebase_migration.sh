SOURCERER WARNING

Assuming your migration is the latest one, it's a lot easier to migrate down
before rebasing. If you're in the middle of a rebase, we can't migrate down now
because the migrate command will get confused by the duplicate migrations we're
about to fix.

If you haven't already migrated down, you may want to consider aborting your
rebase, migrating down, then re-running this script:

    git rebase --abort
    ./dev/db/migrate.sh down $(($# - 1))
    git rebase origin/main          # or whatever you're rebasing on
    $0 $@

Done!

Don't forget to regenerate the bindata and schema before continuing your
rebase:

    rm migrations/$database/bindata.go
    go generate ./migrations/$database
    ./dev/db/migrate.sh $database up
    go generate ./internal/database

Then git add everything and continue the rebase.
