# buildchecker

`buildchecker` is designed to respond to periods of consecutive build failures on a Buildkite pipeline.
Owned by the [DevX team](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/product-engineering/engineering/enablement/dev-experience).

More documentation for Sourcegraph teammates is available in the[CI incidents playbook](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/product-engineering/engineering/process/incidents/playbooks/ci#scenarios).

## Usage

Available commands:

- [`buildchecker check`](#check)
- [`buildchecker history`](#history)

### Check

Checks for a series of build failures that exceed the configured threshold, locks the target branch, and posts various updates to Slack.

```sh
go run ./dev/buildchecker/ check # directly
./dev/buildchecker/run-check.sh  # using wrapper script
```

Also see the [`buildchecker` GitHub Action workflow](../../.github/workflows/buildchecker.yml) where `buildchecker check` is run on an automated basis.

### History

Writes aggregated historical data, including the builds it finds, to a few files.

```sh
go run ./dev/buildchecker -buildkite.token=$BUILDKITE_TOKEN -failures.timeout=999 -created.from="2021-08-01" history
```

To load builds from a file instead of fetching from Buildkite, use `-load-from="$FILE"`.

## Tokens

### Buildkite API token

Required for all `buildchecker` commands, except for `buildchecker history -load-from`.

1. Go over [your personal settings](https://buildkite.com/user/api-access-tokens)
2. Create a new token with the following permissions:

- check `sourcegraph` organization
- `read_builds`
- `read_pipelines`

## Development

- `branch_test.go` contains integration tests against the GitHub API. Normally runs against recordings in `testdata` - to update `testdata`, run the tests with the `-update` flag.
- All other tests are strictly unit tests.
