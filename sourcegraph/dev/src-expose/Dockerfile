# Ensures that a directory with the correct permissions exist in the image. Without this, in Docker Compose
# deployments the Docker daemon would first create the volume directory and it would be owned by `root` and
# then a non-root process would be unable to create the `/app/data` because it
# would  be trying to do so in a directory owned by `root` as the user `sourcegraph`. And no, this is not
# dumb, this is just Docker: https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/3270#issuecomment-363478501.
