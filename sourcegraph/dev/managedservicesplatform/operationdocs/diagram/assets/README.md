# MSP Architecture Diagrams

Diagrams are primarily sourced from the [D2 Icons](https://icons.terrastruct.com/) library.

Icons for other services can generally be found from a company's branding/PR page.

Files must be encoded as a data URI such that they can be embedded into the SVGs. Conversion can be using a [converter tool](https://www.adminbooster.com/tool/data_uri)
