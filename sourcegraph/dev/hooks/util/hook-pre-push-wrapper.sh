#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# A script that receives a Husky git pre-push hook to invoke another script ($check_script) with the
# following environment variables set with information received from the pre-push hook.
#
# Husky stores the stdin and command-line args from the pre-push hook in the $HUSKY_GIT_STDIN and
# $HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS env vars. This script uses those and requires them to be set.
#
# From the git pre-push docs (https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_pre_push):
#
# > This hook is called by git-push[1] and can be used to prevent a push from taking place. The hook
# > is called with two parameters which provide the name and location of the destination remote, if
# > a named remote is not being used both values will be the same.
# >
# > Information about what is to be pushed is provided on the hookâ€™s standard input with lines of
# > the form:
# >
# > <local ref> SP <local sha1> SP <remote ref> SP <remote sha1> LF
# >
# > For instance, if the command git push origin master:foreign were run the hook would receive a
# > line like the following:
# >
# > refs/heads/master 67890 refs/heads/foreign 12345
# >
# > although the full, 40-character SHA-1s would be supplied. If the foreign ref does not yet exist
# > the <remote SHA-1> will be 40 0. If a ref is to be deleted, the <local ref> will be supplied as
# > (delete) and the <local SHA-1> will be 40 0. If the local commit was specified by something
# > other than a name which could be expanded (such as HEAD~, or a SHA-1) it will be supplied as it
# > was originally given.
# >
# > If this hook exits with a non-zero status, git push will abort without pushing
# > anything. Information about why the push is rejected may be sent to the user by writing to
# > standard error.
