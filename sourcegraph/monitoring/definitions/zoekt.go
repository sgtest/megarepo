								Processes have a limited about of memory map areas that they can use. In Zoekt, memory map areas
								are mainly used for loading shards into memory for queries (via mmap). However, memory map areas
								are also used for loading shared libraries, etc.

								_See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_file and the related articles for more information about memory maps._

								Once the memory map limit is reached, the Linux kernel will prevent the process from creating any
								additional memory map areas. This could cause the process to crash.
							`,
							NextSteps: `
								If you are running out of memory map areas, you could resolve this by:

								    - Enabling shard merging for Zoekt: Set SRC_ENABLE_SHARD_MERGING="1" for zoekt-indexserver. Use this option
								if your corpus of repositories has a high percentage of small, rarely updated repositories. See
								[documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/explanations/search_details#shard-merging).
								    - Creating additional Zoekt replicas: This spreads all the shards out amongst more replicas, which
								means that each _individual_ replica will have fewer shards. This, in turn, decreases the
								amount of memory map areas that a _single_ replica can create (in order to load the shards into memory).
								    - Increasing the virtual memory subsystem's "max_map_count" parameter which defines the upper limit of memory areas
								a process can use. The default value of max_map_count is usually 65536. We recommend to set this value to 2x the number
								of repos to be indexed per Zoekt instance. This means, if you want to index 240k repositories with 3 Zoekt instances,
								set max_map_count to (240000 / 3) * 2 = 160000. The exact instructions for tuning this parameter can differ depending
								on your environment. See https://kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt for more information.
