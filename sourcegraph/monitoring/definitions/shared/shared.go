// Package shared contains shared declarations between dashboards. In general, you should NOT be making
// changes to this package: we use a declarative style for monitoring intentionally, so you should err
// on the side of repeating yourself and NOT writing shared or programatically generated monitoring.
//
// When editing this package or introducing any shared declarations, you should abide strictly by the
// following rules:
//
// 1. Do NOT declare a shared definition unless 5+ dashboards will use it. Sharing dashboard
//    declarations means the codebase becomes more complex and non-declarative which we want to avoid
//    so repeat yourself instead if it applies to less than 5 dashboards.
//
// 2. ONLY declare shared Observables. Introducing shared Rows or Groups prevents individual dashboard
//    maintainers from holistically considering both the layout of dashboards as well as the
//    metrics and alerts defined within them -- which we do not want.
//
// 3. Use the sharedObservable type and do NOT parameterize more than just the container name. It may
//    be tempting to pass an alerting threshold as an argument, or parameterize whether a critical
//    alert is defined -- but this makes reasoning about alerts at a high level much more difficult.
//    If you have a need for this, it is a strong signal you should NOT be using the shared definition
//    anymore and should instead copy it and apply your modifications.
