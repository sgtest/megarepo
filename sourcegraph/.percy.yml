  # Defer uploading snapshots until the very end of the test suite.
  # This allows many snapshots with the same name AND different widths to be merged together.
  # This is useful for flaky client integration tests that can be retried automatically.
  #
  # This should prevent creating a Percy build if the test suite fails according to sources:
  # 1. The exit code is used force stop the local Percy server: https://github.com/percy/cli/blob/9c89383d6e1a9aa41f0c83f8e4b9ddcdf827583b/packages/cli-exec/src/exec.js#L78-L81
  # 2. The `force` options is propagated to `this.#snapshots.close(true)`: https://github.com/percy/cli/blob/master/packages/core/src/percy.js#L219-L223
  # 3. The snapshots queue is cleared if `force` is true: https://github.com/percy/cli/blob/9c89383d6e1a9aa41f0c83f8e4b9ddcdf827583b/packages/core/src/queue.js#L177
