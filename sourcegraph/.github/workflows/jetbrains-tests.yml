# GitHub Actions Workflow created for testing the JetBrains extension plugin in following steps:
#
# - validate Gradle Wrapper
# - run 'test' tasks
# - run 'buildPlugin' task
#
# Note: This workflow works in isolation to the JavaScript artifacts necessary for full testing. It
#       is intended to only test if the Java plugin compiles without issues.
