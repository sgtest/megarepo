## Delivery plan

The overall plan for how we are going to achieve this roadmap item. This should be formulated as a checklist of concrete steps that are kept up-to-date so anyone can glace at the issue description to get a sense of what we have already delivered and what remains.

Each item on this list is ideally a concrete deliverable with an estimated delivery date and owner, but we don't want false precision, so just document the plan to the best of your ability, even if you don't have all the steps yet.
