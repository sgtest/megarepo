# To generate a new mock struct from an interface definition, add a new entry to one of
# the lists in a file below (or create a new file if the current categories do not fit).
#
# Each item will need to supply the following pieces of information:
#
#  (1) First, you will need to give a target filename
#  (2) Second, you will need to supply a target import path and interface name. If the
#      set of interface definitions you are mocking are all from the same package, then
#      you can supply a `path` and `interfaces` key which take a string and string array,
#      respectively. If the set of interface definitions you are mocking come from multiple
#      import paths, you can supply a `sources` array, each item containing a `path` and
#      `interfaces` key.
#
# By convention, you should generate mocks next to the CONSUMER of an interface, not the
# definition. It is NOT considered an anti-pattern to generate multiple mocks for the same
# shared interface.
#
# By convention, the filename containing generated mocks should be `mocks_test.go`.
