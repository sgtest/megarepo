// attributionRunFilter implementation of CompletionsFilter that runs attribution search for snippets
// aboce certain threshold defined by `SnippetLowerBound`.
// It's inspired by an idea of [communicating sequential processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes):
//   - Attribution search is going to run async of passing down the completion from the LLM.
//   - But all the work of actually forwarding LLM completions happens only on the _caller_
//     thread, that is the one that controls the filter by calling `Send` and `WaitDone`.
//     Hopefully this will ensure proper desctruction of response sending and no races
//     with attribution search.
//   - The synchronization with attribution search happens on 3 elements:
//     1.  `sync.Once` is used to ensure attribution search is only fired once.
//     This simplifies logic of starting search once snippet passed a given threshold.
//     2.  `atomic.Bool` is set to true once we confirm no attribution was found.
//     This makes it real easy for `Send` to make a decision on the spot whether or not
//     to forward a completion back to the client.
//     3.  `chan struct{}` is closed on attribution search finishing.
//     This is a robust way for `WaitDone` to wait on either context cancellation (timeout)
//     or attribution search finishing (via select). Channel closing happens
//     in the attribution search routine, which is fired via sync.Once, so no chance
//     of multiple goroutines closing the channel.
