// Observer is an interface for observing and tracking the memory usage of a process.

// as well as retrieve the maximum memory usage of the observed process.
//
// Callers must call Stop when they are done with the observer to release any associated resources.

	// Start starts the observer. It should be called before any other method.
	//
	// After Start is called, callers must call Stop when they are done with the

	// Calling Start() multiple times is safe and has no effect after the first invocation.
