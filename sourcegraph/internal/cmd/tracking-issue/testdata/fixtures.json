  "Body": "### Plan\r\n\r\n**Goal:** Get the top three most popular language indexers: lsif-go, lsif-java, lsif-clang stable by working directly on implementation with customers to identify and resolve any remaining issues that prevent the tool from being use in a wide release. This goal takes top priority for this milestone and each member of the team is leading the initiative on an indexer. \r\n\r\n**Goal:** Improve the reliability and the precise code intel backend by migrating data away from SQLite and into a more suitable database, Postgres.\r\n\r\n**Goal:** Improve best effort auto-indexing for supported languages (see issues related to RFC 201).\r\n\r\n### Availability\r\n\r\nPeriod is from 2020-09-20 to 2020-10-20.

Find a popular open source C++ repository which is not already documented in this thread. if you can think of one yourself, do that! otherwise here's some lists: [GitHub trending](https://github.com/trending/c++), [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/?language=C%2B%2B), [awesome-cpp](https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp).\r\n1. Follow the documentation on this repo to create an lsif index of the chosen repository. For now, use the [simplify-cmake](https://github.com/sourcegraph/lsif-clang/tree/simplify-cmake) branch. If you're unable to create an index, file a bug documenting what you tried.\r\n1. Follow the sourcegraph documentation to upload the lsif index to sourcegraph.com, and confirm that the c++ codenav works (feel free to spend lots of time here, C++ is a strange beast so click on some strange code to make sure it's getting indexed properly!)\r\n1. Document the steps from cloning to successful index creation (not including getting deps for and building lsif-clang)\r\n\r\nSteps for Garo:\r\n\r\n1. Reproduce all of the above",

We'll provide updates on this issue as we learn more.\r\n\r\nCustomers: https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/2762526/company/407948923 ",

Users aren't configuring repositories to upload LSIF data.\r\n\r\n    1. LSIF is a non-trivial amount of technical work to setup, which is a barrier to adoption.\r\n\r\n        **SOLUTION: Expand the number of languages and cases where we can automatically index repositories with LSIF. Use data from sourcegraph.com to determine which repositories are the source of the most search based code intel queries.**\r\n\r\n    1. Even though the technical work to setup LSIF is straightforward, we have observed that engineers who are motivated to do this work get blocked due to how their organization functions (e.g., adding stuff to CI is hard and/or requires approvals).\r\n\r\n        **SOLUTION: Make it possible to configure LSIF auto-indexing within Sourcegraph without needing to make a change to your company's CI system for common cases.**\r\n\r\n1. We have multiple customers who want precise C++ code intel and current DXP approach is not sufficient.\r\n\r\n    **SOLUTION: Ship MVP of new clangd indexer to [C1](https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/2762526/company/2931649618/), [C2](https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/2762526/company/947819054/)**\r\n\r\n1. Users don't understand that there are two kinds of code intelligence. When they encounter issues with imprecise code intel, they don't know how to enable precise code intel. When precise code intel is configured, but is unavailable for multiple possible reasons, it is not clear to the user why they are seeing imprecise code intel.\r\n\r\n    **SOLUTION: Improve hover tooltips to include more information on the state/source of code intel.**\r\n\r\n1. [C1](https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/2762526/company/464956351/) and [C2](https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/2762526/company/554275594/) are blocked from adopting LSIF because they have large repositories with high commit rates.\r\n\r\n    **SOLUTION: Design incremental indexing (start validating assumptions next month).

This milestone will make progress of removing the known blockers for these companies by following tasks (will still need a follow-up in (at least) the 3.20 milestone):\r\n\r\nBuilding a prototype to speed up indexing on all repos. This is necessary for large monorepos as indexing the entire codebase is infeasible. This prototype will act as the feasibility study referenced in the [RFC 170](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NPu0Vc7FpdoYwCrtpnu-8KB4OPbw7L0KBTqw96JVc8w). If we determine that this technique is viable, then the 3.20 milestone will focus on a proper implementation of the prototype (which also requires updating indexers to create patch indexes). @efritz @gbrik \r\n\r\n**Goal 2: Improve developer experience for use of LSIF in CI**\r\n\r\nUsers aren't configuring LSIF in CI because it is technically cumbersome, carries a maintenance burden, difficult to explain, and may involve red tape. We are aiming to alleviate these issues by automating the process and reduce number setup steps needed by developers to deploy. To support this effort we are also going to create additional quickstart documentation.\r\n\r\n**Goal 3: Increase LSIF adoption**\r\n\r\nUsers are blocked from adopting LSIF because existing indexers don't support their use case, or there is no indexer for their language. We plan to distribute lsif-clang to customers that already have precise C++ support to ensure that it continues to meet their use case and is ready for wider distribution. We will also write a plan for precise SWIFT \u0026 Java support. \r\n\r\n**Goal 4: Resolve technical debt to improve quality and reliability**\r\n\r\nThis work is to improve overall quality of code intel components, including fixing worker concurrency bug, UI hover experience and implementing graceful failover for bundle manager.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Availability\r\n\r\nPeriod is from **2020-07-20** to **2020-08-20**.

This will cause an error to be returned by the resolver. We should instead eat this error during step 2 and move on to the next candidate bundle.",

The janitor is now responsible for hard deleting these records after cleaning up their associated data.\r\n\r\nIn the future, this will allow the janitor to more safely delete data associated with a missing record (if it's soft deleted we know it's not an accident; if it's missing we don't know if it's a part of a database backup, a misconfiguration, etc). There should be no user-observable behavioral changes in this PR.\r\n\r\nThis also does a bit of work required by https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/12168, as detailed in the related RFC.",
