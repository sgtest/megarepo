This goal takes top priority for this milestone and each member of the team is leading the initiative on an indexer. \r\n\r\n**Goal:** Perform research spikes of features such as Bazel integration (to improve monorepos support) in order to find the best approach, and scope the development effort for adding new core capabilities to code intel platform.\r\n\r\n**Goal:** Improve the reliability and usability of code intel tools by triaging and resolving UI bugs and performance issues (i.e. the bundle manager process) for an improved developer experience.\r\n\r\n### Availability\r\n\r\nPeriod is from 2020-09-20 to 2020-10-20.

The janitor is now responsible for hard deleting these records after cleaning up their associated data.\r\n\r\nIn the future, this will allow the janitor to more safely delete data associated with a missing record (if it's soft deleted we know it's not an accident; if it's missing we don't know if it's a part of a database backup, a misconfiguration, etc). There should be no user-observable behavioral changes in this PR.\r\n\r\nThis also does a bit of work required by https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/12168, as detailed in the related RFC.",
