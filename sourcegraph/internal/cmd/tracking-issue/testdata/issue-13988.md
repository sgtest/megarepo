### Plan

#### Cloud

We plan to complete all functional changes necessary to have individual Sourcegraphers (teammates) be able to add public code on sourcegraph.com. This is part of our first Cloud milestone as documented in [our team page](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/engineering/cloud). All work items on this goal are labeled with `RFC-211` and `team/cloud/milestone-1`.

#### Security

For Cloud Milestone 1, in addition to the functional changes above, we need to complete the necessary work to store relevant secrets securely (i.e. encrypted). Even for public code, it's important that we store teammates access tokens in an encrypted fashion. All work items on this goal are labeled with `RFC-214` and `team/cloud/milestone-1`.

Additionally, we have some miscellaneous security bugs to address, marked appropriately with 🔒 in the Work section below.

#### Backend infrastructure

**RFC 167: Generate new licenses with versioned tags** is small enough and we can get the benefit of new licenses already being versioned, minimising the migration effort needed by the sales team later. The remainder of the work in RFC-167 accounts for roughly 2 weeks and we tentatively plan to take it on in the next cycle.

We'll also work on a number of customer issues and tech-debt, marked appropriately with 👩  and 🧶 in the Work section below.

### Availability

**Period**: 23rd of September until the 6th of October (10 working days)

If you have planned unavailability this iteration (e.g., vacation), you can note that here.

- @ryanslade: 24th of September (1d) 
- @daxmc99: 28th of September (1d)
- @unknwon: 1st until 8th of October (4d)
