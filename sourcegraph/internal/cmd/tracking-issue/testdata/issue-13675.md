### Plan

#### [Support new and existing deployments](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/74)

This is an ongoing expense, we anticipate this taking no more than 10d of work spread across the entire team.

#### Support Security in deploying a log analysis tool

Security is planning to deploy a centralized logging and analysis system and will require our assistance to setup and review this new infrastructure.

#### [Implement 2+ sourcegraph.com services using dhall](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/71)

`sourcegraph.com` sees the highest amount of Kubernetes changes out of all of our deployments + `deploy-sourcegraph`. Scoping a single component limits the customizations that we need to implement and allows for easier onboarding other engineers.

#### [Releases are created in a single day](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/90)

We have a goal of reducing the time it takes to create releases, and this current several-day system has encouraged us to view releases as “baked” rather than “snapshots of the main branch”, leading to situations where main is broken and we have to retrospectively fix it or adding last minute features.

#### [Split infrastructure into separate GCP projects](https://github.com/orgs/sourcegraph/projects/92)

GCP utilizes project wide roles and permissions, to ensure resources are isolated from each other and reduce the blast radius of changes, we should split resources into separate projects. Additionally, this will grant us more insight into our infrastructure costs and will become more important as we grow and expand it.
