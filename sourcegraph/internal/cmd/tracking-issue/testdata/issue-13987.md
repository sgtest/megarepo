### Plan

**Goal:** Get the top three most popular language indexers: lsif-go, lsif-java, lsif-clang stable by working directly on implementation with customers to identify and resolve any remaining issues that prevent the tool from being use in a wide release. This goal takes top priority for this milestone and each member of the team is leading the initiative on an indexer. 

**Goal:** Improve the reliability and the precise code intel backend by migrating data away from SQLite and into a more suitable database, Postgres.

**Goal:** Improve best effort auto-indexing for supported languages (see issues related to RFC 201).

### Availability

Period is from 2020-09-20 to 2020-10-20. Please write the days you won't be working and the number of working days for the period.

* Aida: 10d
* Eric: 19d (off 2020/09/28-30)
