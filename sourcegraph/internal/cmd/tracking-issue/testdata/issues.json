Could we slot either a gate or at least a ping back/stats on those into the next release? Getting this info from clients will definitely impact new ARR as well as upsell potential.\r\n\r\nAnd my response:\r\n\r\n\u003eLooks like we DO have enforcement for this (see https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@837b3b25d94e180864c7d1b7276a235a1ed9933a/-/blob/enterprise/cmd/frontend/internal/licensing/features.go#L19:2) but that we are not yet restricting it from basic Enterprise tier: https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@837b3b25d94e180864c7d1b7276a235a1ed9933a/-/blob/enterprise/cmd/frontend/internal/licensing/features.go#L45:23\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003eSo this might be an easy update actually!\r\n\u003e\r\n\u003eBasically we just need to add the new tiers (Enterprise Plus and Elite) to our backend and update features to map to them: https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@837b3b2/-/blob/enterprise/cmd/frontend/internal/dotcom/billing/plans.go#L27\r\n",

Create Campaign with 10 changesets *in draft mode*\n2. Publish 2 of 10 changesets, creating them on code hosts\n3. Update Campaign to change name, description or arguments (`scopeQuery`, `matchTemplate`, ...)\n4. 2 already-published changesets are updated/closed on code hosts.\n\nSupporting this is not trivial, since we'd effectively need to detect\nwhether we're in this subset-published mode and depending on that, do a\ndifferent update than we'd do otherwise.\n\n#### Option A\n\nIn the normal update path (all or no changesets are published), we create \"missing changesets\" on codehosts that haven't been created before.\n\nBut in this new subset-update path (where only subset of changesets is published), we haven't created `ChangesetJobs` for all repositories yet, so we shouldn't create those now.\n\nInstead, we should _only_ update the Changesets that have already been published, but _only_ if the updated Campaign would create them again.\n\nIf the updated Campaign would _not_ create them again, we'd need to close them.\n\n#### Option B\n\nAnother possibility: when you update a Campaign, all already-published changesets are closed by default and only recreated/updated when you re-publish them individually or publish the whole Campaign.",

   "Title": "Automation should never miss search results",
   "Body": "In its current state Automation campaigns might miss search results because of the way it interacts with our search infrastructure. See [this comment chain](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/7790#discussion_r367736633) for the full context. Below are a few excerpts\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@rvantonder in https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/7790#discussion_r367736633:\r\n\r\n\u003e Here's a breakdown of things:\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e - for the repo question: this  (to me) is a problem where we don't have the possibility of two things at the same time: (1) a clean way to operate on a repo given we know what the repo is already and (2) a filtering mechanism to only run on certain files, or with certain constraints. The nice thing about replacer is that it actually solves (1) as far as the API is concerned: just give it the repo, it'll do the fetching, and it'll run comby on all the files (there is a way to filter files, but it is not _exactly_ the same as what we support in the query). But the point is there's no danger of fiddling with queries/escaping. The problem: the replacer interface is too rudimentary to understand/implement the full spectrum of our search query. The frontend/search interface (2) _does_ understand the full query and can perform the filtering mechanism (useful!) but the problem is that we need to mess around with the query to do that properly. I agree this is the best possible option right now, but there is another danger hidden in (2). Next point.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e - Any time we ever call `newSearch`, we are never guaranteed to find all matches. For search/replace, it is imperative that we (a) always try our hardest to replace every instance (i.e., we will wait!) or (b) if we don't get everything, we need to know about what was missed. It would be great if there was a knob to say 'search and replace this, just guarantee me that you found every single instance', but there is a ton of search functionality across concerns (index/searcher/...) that make adding such a knob very very hard IMO, and it would be easier to build such a \"guaranteed searcher\" 'from scratch in replacer than try layer it onto search. The alternative is that we are cognizant of the limitations of search and monitor it when it tells us 'there were more results, but I didn't return them'. If we go this route, we will need to add a lot of (TBH probably annoying) logic that checks the state of returned results, refetches, and all that. I'm not even sure how we can guarantee that pans out, since search can skip repos _or_ files. It is brittle for this purpose brittle. Pagination gives me some hope that we can do finer accounting and do 'retry' operations in a much easier way (right now we'd have to do the accounting ourselves, somehow).\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e So we have bigger problems than that repo issue. Just for this regex campaign mode, I realized that since this is using searcher, partial results will return quickly, and so I basically will add `count:10000` with no real guarantee that all of the matches are covered. \r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e For example, when I create these campaigns locally:\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e ```\r\n\u003e {\r\n\u003e     \"scopeQuery\": \"repo:github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph file:.*\",\r\n\u003e     \"regexMatch\": \"func\",\r\n\u003e     \"textReplace\": \"foo\"\r\n\u003e }\r\n\u003e ```\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e will have 1048 matches (and returns quickly) while\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e ```\r\n\u003e {\r\n\u003e     \"scopeQuery\": \"repo:github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph file:.* count:10000\",\r\n\u003e     \"regexMatch\": \"func\",\r\n\u003e     \"textReplace\": \"foo\"\r\n\u003e }\r\n\u003e ```\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e will have 10647.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e But there's an even bigger problem than the number of matches getting cut off by `count` or `timer`: it is that when we filter using, e.g., `file`, the list of files can _also_ be cut off. So for example, the query\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e ```\r\n\u003e {\r\n\u003e     \"scopeQuery\": \"repo:github.com/torvalds/linux index:no file:.* count:10000\",\r\n\u003e     \"regexMatch\": \"TODO\",\r\n\u003e     \"textReplace\": \"DONE\"\r\n\u003e }\r\n\u003e ```\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e on my machine will return only 15 matches. That's because we return some number of files (I think 1000 and `count` doesn't appear to do anything) and there are only 15 matches in those files. If I want to force search to try harder, I actually have to use the `regexMatch` value in the `scopeQuery`:\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e ```\r\n\u003e {\r\n\u003e     \"scopeQuery\": \"repo:github.com/torvalds/linux TODO index:no file:.* count:10000\",\r\n\u003e     \"regexMatch\": \"TODO\",\r\n\u003e     \"textReplace\": \"yo\"\r\n\u003e }\r\n\u003e ```\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e This finds 1776 matches. Does this find all the matches? _I still don't know_ and that's the problem. Long term we'll have to think about how to either rearchitect search code or queries to handle this issue, or build up a dedicated replacer service. There's contention in designing for 'time-to-first-result' and 'match-and-replace-all-instances-at-almost-any-cost'.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@rvantonder in https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/7790#discussion_r367868835:\r\n\r\n\u003e To be clear, what I mean is that we need to do (possibly significant) extra work compared to what the current search code is geared towards, not that it's at odds.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e @keegancsmith probably has better insight, but my gut reaction is that using indexed search results/Zoekt is a no go. It is a black box and takes lots of shortcuts in ways that's hard to guarantee that it returns all matches, whether content or files (issue in #7709 may be indicative). Which implies using searcher logic. But searcher doesn't do repo filtering, that happens in the frontend. So there is an interface to cut out here.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@mrnugget in https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/7790#discussion_r367877914:\r\n\r\n\u003e There's two problems we have to address:\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e   1. We need to reliably come up with a list of repositories over which to run Automation campaigns.\r\n\u003e   2. We need to find every search result in each one of these repositories.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e With our current state of campaign types and our roadmpa, I think (1) is already (or can be made) reliable by restricting scopeQuery to only accept repo:. That should always give us the full list of repositories that match the scopeQuery.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e The problem is that once you do that, you start to come up with a lot of false positives. Example: you run a NPM credentials campaign with \"scopeQuery\": \"repo:github\". That returns 200 repos, but only 3 of those have an .npmrc file. So I decided to add file:.npmrc to the scopeQuery. Problem is that, apparently, we're now not reliable anymore without adding count:99999 to it. For regex-search-replace the problem is even bigger, because it can yield more hits.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e Problem (2) is what we're discussing this in this comment chain and now becomes more important with regex-search-and-replace and future campaigns that will run in the background and proactively scan/search repositories.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e I hope that we, builders of code search, can up with a way that allows us to make use of the search infrastructure we already have in a reliable way 😄\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e  [... comment by @rvantonder ...]\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e This comment combined with your earlier comment makes me think again of the idea of combining searcher/replacer into a single service with added \"run code over git repo\" functionality.",

   "Body": "Current state when creating a new CampaignPlan (\"Preview changes\"):\r\n\r\n* We open a transaction\r\n* For each repo the `scopeQuery` yields we create a `CampaignJob`\r\n* For each `CampaignJob` we ask `gitserver` for its default branch\r\n* If `gitserver` cannot determine a default branch the transaction is rolled back\r\n* Otherwise: transaction is committed\r\n\r\n[Here is the code](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/9c41958efbd5ba9bb43c426137d219e935d6ce23/enterprise/internal/a8n/runner.go#L158-L213).\r\n\r\nThat means the transaction is open for the duration of time it takes to\r\nask `gitserver` for _all_ default branches.\r\n\r\nThat's not a problem per se, but it is bad UX since it might take a\r\nwhile until the user sees _something_ after hitting the `\"Preview\r\nchanges\"` button.\r\n\r\nI propose that we move the determination of a `CampaignJob`s `BaseRef`\r\nand `Rev` out of the transaction and set those when actually running the\r\njob [here](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/9c41958efbd5ba9bb43c426137d219e935d6ce23/enterprise/internal/a8n/runner.go#L280-L283).\r\n\r\nThat would require making `rev` and `base_ref` nullable fields in the\r\ndatabase and since we have a database unique constraint on\r\n`(campaign_plan_id, repo_id, rev)` we have to find out how that works\r\nwith `NULL` fields.\r\n\r\nThe upsides:\r\n\r\n1. We don't hammer `gitserver` with possibly hundreds of requests in a tight loop\r\n2. One request failing won't fail the whole `CampaignPlan` but instead result in a single errored `CampaignJob`\r\n3. The user will get faster feedback when previewing changes because the transaction will be much faster since it's not bound to `gitserver` anymore",

This is causing problems with Sourcegraph surfacing the code there rather than in the original repos and confusing people searching for the original code.\r\n\u003e Ideally, we should be able to index the mobile/SmartLinter repo but not index the duplicated code under data/. Failing this, we would be fine with un-listing that repo from Sourcegraph altogether.

   "Title": "Redis AOF file grows unbounded due to frequent container restarts",
   "Body": "_Issue description written by @tsenart and copied here from another private issue._\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\n$CUSTOMER had a P0 incident due to the Redis AOF file not getting compacted as it should. It seems that the reason this happened is due to frequent container restarts.\r\n\r\nThe default Redis configuration for when the AOF file should get compacted is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Automatic rewrite of the append only file.\r\n# Redis is able to automatically rewrite the log file implicitly calling\r\n# BGREWRITEAOF when the AOF log size grows by the specified percentage.\r\n#\r\n# This is how it works: Redis remembers the size of the AOF file after the\r\n# latest rewrite (if no rewrite has happened since the restart, the size of\r\n# the AOF at startup is used).\r\n#\r\n# This base size is compared to the current size. If the current size is\r\n# bigger than the specified percentage, the rewrite is triggered. Also\r\n# you need to specify a minimal size for the AOF file to be rewritten, this\r\n# is useful to avoid rewriting the AOF file even if the percentage increase\r\n# is reached but it is still pretty small.\r\n#\r\n# Specify a percentage of zero in order to disable the automatic AOF\r\n# rewrite feature.\r\n\r\nauto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100\r\nauto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn particular, `if no rewrite has happened since the restart, the size of the AOF at startup is used` is of particular concern and would explain what we're seeing. If the Docker container restarts frequently enough, redis won't have the chance to reach 100% of the previous AOF base size, so the next time around it starts up, it takes the AOF file size *at that point* as the new base over which it needs to double again. This can go ad-nauseum, theoretically.\r\n\r\n### Remediation\r\n\r\n$CUSTOMER is setting up monitoring of disk space usage and has a working playbook for manually triggering AOF file compaction.\r\n\r\n### Resolution\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand it, this seems like a design issue in Redis and it should only affect our Docker image deployment because of all the restarts that other processes can trigger.\r\n\r\n#### Action Items:\r\n\r\n1. [ ] **Create a work-around on our side**: Instead of relying on automatic background compaction, we can trigger it every-time after redis comes up. This can be done via the sourcegraph-frontend, or through a redis run script in `sourcegraph/server`.\r\n\r\n3. [ ] Open an issue (or find one) in Redis upstream.\r\n2. [ ] Figure out why the Docker container is restarting so often. See Relevant Logs section for a possible hint.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Incident Log\r\nhttps://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/GDS3PJ8GK/p1554732996001200\r\n\r\n### Relevant Logs\r\n\r\n[Similarly to what $CUSTOMER is seeing](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/viewer?authuser=1\u0026organizationId=1006954638239\u0026project=sourcegraph-dev\u0026resource=container%2Fcluster_name%2Fdogfood%2Fnamespace_id%2Fdefault\u0026minLogLevel=0\u0026expandAll=false\u0026timestamp=2019-04-08T17%3A13%3A40.800000000Z\u0026customFacets\u0026limitCustomFacetWidth=true\u0026interval=NO_LIMIT\u0026scrollTimestamp=2019-03-23T07%3A17%3A40.000000000Z\u0026pinnedLogId=jzf1w8f880bcc\u0026pinnedLogTimestamp=2019-03-23T07%3A17%3A03Z\u0026advancedFilter=resource.type%3D%22container%22%0Aresource.labels.cluster_name%3D%22dogfood%22%0Aresource.labels.container_name%3D%22sourcegraph-server%22%0Aresource.labels.namespace_id%3D%22default%22%0Aresource.labels.instance_id%3D%22355508537060902802%22%0Aresource.labels.zone%3D%22us-central1-a%22%0Aresource.labels.project_id%3D%22sourcegraph-dev%22%0Atimestamp%3E%3D%222019-03-23T07%3A13%3A00.000000000Z%22), our Dogfood docker deployment has seen occurrences where the container crashes for no apparent reason, followed by Redis errors on startup.",

   "Title": "Code host fingerprinter",
   "Body": "An experiment to drastically simplify our onboarding process for most first time admins. A user gives us an URL from the code host and we discover what kind of code host it is and a reasonable config for it. We should be able to discover what kind of code host most are via normalizing URLs and trying well-known and unique queries.\r\n\r\nThe deliverable for this experiment is a simple binary which takes the URL and spits out our guess. If it seems to work reasonably well, we can look into integrating it into an onboarding flow.",

   "Body": "Provide an explicit session invalidation mechanism for Sourcegraph.\r\n\r\nCurrently, sessions are invalidated after they expire (configurable via the `auth.sessionExpiry` option) or on user sign-out. Proposal is to also enable explicit session invalidation in the following scenarios:\r\n* An admin manually invalidates all sessions for a given user.\r\n* A user's existing sessions are invalidated after successful password reset under built-in auth.",
