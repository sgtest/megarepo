  # Each commit here is tagged as sg-test-1, sg-test-2, and sg-test-3, respectively. See CHANGES.md in the root of the
  # repository's master branch to see a history of changes and which revisions were targetted. We specifically use replace
  # directives in the project root's go.mod file to target sourcegraph-testing/zap, which has no changes of its own. This
  # simulates how common forking works in the Go ecosystem (see our own use of zoekt).
  #
  # To ensure that the last commit in the list for each repository is visible at tip, the master branch's last commit is
  # a merge commit between the true upstream tip and sg-test-3.
