// [NOTE: Dependency-terminology]
// In a dependency graph of packages, such as when doing package resolution,
// you have the notion of dependencies as a pair of a package + a version range
// (potentially having only one version in the limiting case) + potentially
// some other information. After resolution, dependencies are pinned to a
// specific version.
//
// From the point of view of package repository support in Sourcegraph, the
// notion of a dependency corresponds to the latter, since package resolution
// is handled by the appropriate package manager, and we only deal with the frozen
// dependency versions when generating LSIF.
//
// This is why a dependency can be represented as a package + version pair.
//
// One edge case here is the root of the graph, which is technically not a
// dependency. However, we still use the same type to represent the root for
// practical purposes. For naming values, prefer "VersionedPackage" for
// situations where there is no connotation of a dependency edge.
