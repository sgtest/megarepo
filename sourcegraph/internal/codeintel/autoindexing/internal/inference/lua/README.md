# Sourcegraph Lua Indexers

To get the same lua formatting, make sure to install
[Stylua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua) or corresponding editor
plugin. The changes should automatically pick up based on the `.stylua.toml` in
this directory.

We could investigate using something like Selene or other tools to enforce that
we don't have any typos across Lua-Go boundary, but I'll leave the for future exploration.
