// For OR queries, there are two phases:
// 1) Stream any results that are found in every subquery
// 2) Once all subqueries have completed, send the results we've found that
//    were returned by some subqueries, but not all subqueries.
//
// This means that the only time we would hit streaming limit before we have
// results from all subqueries is if we hit the limit only with results from
// phase 1. These results are very "fair" in that they are found in all
// subqueries.
//
// Then, in phase 2, we send all results that were returned by at least one
// sub-query. These are generated from a map iteration, so the document order
// is random, meaning that when/if they are truncated to fit inside the limit,
// they will be from a random distribution of sub-queries.
//
// This solution has the following nice properties:
// - Early cancellation is possible
// - Results are streamed where possible, decreasing user-visible latency
// - The only results that are streamed are "fair" results. They are "fair" because
//   they were returned from every subquery, so there can be no bias between subqueries
// - The only time we cancel early is when streamed results hit the limit. Since the only
//   streamed results are "fair" results, there will be no bias against slow or low-volume subqueries
// - Every result we stream is guaranteed to be "complete". By "complete", I mean if I search for "a or b",
//   the streamed result will highlight both "a" and "b" if they both exist in the document.
// - The bias is towards documents that match all of our subqueries, so doesn't bias any individual subquery.
//   Additionally, a bias towards matching all subqueries is probably desirable, since it's more likely that
//   a document matching all subqueries is what the user is looking for than a document matching only one.
