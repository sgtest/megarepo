# Geolocation data

This package contains a small geolocation database that gets embedded in the `internal/requestclient/geolocation` package.
We currently use the [DB-IP.com](https://db-ip.com/)'s ["IP to Country Lite" database](https://db-ip.com/db/download/ip-to-country-lite) in MMDB format, which only includes country-level data.

The free DB-IP Lite database by DB-IP is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

## Updating the database

This database was last updated 11/16/2023. We should aim to update this yearly to stay in sync with any changes.

The database should be downloaded in MMDB format the ["IP to Country Lite" database page](https://db-ip.com/db/download/ip-to-country-lite).
