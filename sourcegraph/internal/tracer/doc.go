// Package tracer initializes Sourcegraph's switchable tracing and log15 behavior. It also updates distributed
// tracing behavior in response to changes in site configuration. When the Init function of this
// package is invoked, opentracing.SetGlobalTracer is called (and subsequently called again after
// every Sourcegraph site configuration change).
// Programs should not invoke opentracing.SetGlobalTracer anywhere else unless called from this package
// This package leverages switchableTracer to allow runtime changes of the underlying tracing provider
// To create spans, use the functions ot.StartSpan and ot.StartSpanFromContext from the ot package
package tracer
