# Encryption

This package provides tools to encrypt & decrypt data via the `encryption.Key` interface. This interface is built to wrap any encryption backend, such as cloud provider APIs, stdlib encryption libraries, or testing stubs.

This package was originally designed in [RFC 310](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZlQzlTRtrQbx3yi2cqmSjyq3ddcp2eKnhqekLOvzm_w/edit#).

### How to use this package

Keys should be passed in/set during initialisation, ideally from `main()`. Accessing `keyring.Default` is an antipattern, and only provided for cases where injection is particularly difficult. You should also only pass the individual key(s) that you need, rather than the whole ring.

Data should be kept encrypted for as long as possible. Right now our implementations are decrypting data inside the `database` package, which is an antipattern. We made this choice in order to make progress as the code did not lend itself easily to moving the decryption out of the store. Ideally you keep the data encrypted until it is passed to whatever needs the zero visibility data.

### How to add a new Key

If you need to encrypt some data, but we don't have a dedicated key for that data yet, you should probably add a new Key. In order to do this you need to do a few things:

- Add config to `encryption.keys` in site config (`schema/site.schema.json`), adding a new field of type `#/definitions/EncryptionKey`.
- Add a line to `keyring.NewRing` to call `NewKey(ctx, keyConfig.YourKeyName)` to initialise this key in the keyring.

### How to add a new Key implementation

If you want to implement a different encryption backend, you'll need to add a new Key implementation, in order to do this you should:

- Create your implementation in a subpackage of encryption, eg `encryption/somebackend`.
- Add a new `SomethingEncryptionKey` schema in `schema/site.schema.json`, with the `type` field set to the name of your implementation.
- Add the name of your key to the `type` enum on the `EncryptionKey` schema definition.
- Add a reference to the new schema to the `oneOf` array on the `EncryptionKey`. This means we generate a `schema.EncryptionKeys` type with all of the key configs as fields, this is done by the `!go: {"taggedUnionType": true}` expression on `EncryptionKey`.
- Then add a case to the switch statement in `keyring.NewKey()` to initialise your key if the config is provided.

### Zero visibility data (`encryption.Secret`)

The plaintext returned by the `Key.Decrypt()` method is considered 'zero visibility data'. This means that no human should ever be able to see this data, and if someone does it should be considered compromised, and be replaced. In order to make accidental disclosure more difficult the encryption package returns data in an `encryption.Secret` wrapper type. This type wraps a value in a struct with an unexported field, implementing the `Stringer` & `json.Marshaler` interfaces & redacting the data. The only method that returns the plaintext is `Secret.Secret()`, this means our handling of secrets is more auditable, and reduces the chances of accidentally leaking the value in logs.

### Keyring

The `encryption/keyring` package provides a way to configure encryption keys & retrieve them in a typesafe manner, it parses site config and sets the keys in a `keyring.Ring` struct, so users can either access the `keyring.Default` or inject the ring, and access specific keys safely, rather than needing to spread around the concern of correctly configuring a key.

### Composition & extension

The `encryption.Key` interface was built to be simple, and intended to be extended through composition & embedding. For example key migrations using a Key implementation that wraps two other Keys, decrypting with one & encrypting with the other. You could also create an encryption.Key wrapper that implements its own versioning system, encrypting with a 'primary' Key, but being able to decrypt data with the previous keys.
