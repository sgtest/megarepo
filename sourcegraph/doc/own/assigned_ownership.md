# Assigned ownership

Owners (both users and teams) can be manually assigned. Assignment can be done on a repository, directory or a file level.

Assigned ownership propagates in a top-down manner: e.g.
- If an owner is assigned to the repository, they will be considered an owner for all files and directories of this repository.
- If an owner is assigned to some directory (e.g. `repo-name/src/abc`) within the repo, they will be considered an owner for all the directories and files within `repo-name/src/abc`, but not for any other directories and files higher up in the hierarchy.
- If an owner is assigned to some file (e.g. `repo-name/src/abc/a.go`) within the repo, they will be considered an owner only for this file.

## Who can assign ownership

Only site admins can assign ownership by default. For other users, [RBAC should be used](../admin/access_control/ownership.md) to grant assign ownership right.

### Note on removing assigned owners

Owners can be removed only at the same level they were initially assigned. For example:
- If an owner is assigned to the repository, they should be removed from the repository level. They cannot be removed from any directory/file within this repo, even though they are considered owners of these directories/files.
- If an owner is assigned to some directory within the repo, they should be removed from the same directory. They cannot be removed from any subdirectory/file below this directory, even though they are considered owners of these subdirectories/files.
- If an owner is assigned to some file within the repo, they should be removed from the same file.

**"Remove ownership" buttons are disabled and the tooltip is shown when a user is attempting to remove an owner from the different place from where this owner has been assigned.**
