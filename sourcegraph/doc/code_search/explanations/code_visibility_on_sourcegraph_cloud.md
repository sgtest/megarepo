# Who can see your code on Sourcegraph Cloud

Note: [Sourcegraph Cloud for Teams](https://about.sourcegraph.com/cloud-beta/) is in private beta today. [Join our waitlist](https://share.hsforms.com/14OQ3RoPpQTOXvZlUpgx6-A1n7ku?utm_medium=direct-traffic&utm_source=docs&utm_content=cloud-product-beta-teams) to get access today!

Sourcegraph Cloud protects your private code using repository permissions from GitHub.com and GitLab.com to determine who can see repositories you've [added to Sourcegraph Cloud](../how-to/adding_repositories_to_cloud.md).

## Public repositories
If a repository is public on GitHub.com or GitLab.com, other users on Sourcegraph Cloud can view and search across that repository. The repository will appear in the global search context.

## Private repositories (Public Beta)
If a repository is private on GitHub or GitLab, only users who have permission to access that repository on the code host **and** have added that repository to Sourcegraph Cloud, you can view and search that repository. The repository will not appear in search results for other users.

The Sourcegraph team and administrators on Sourcegraph Cloud cannot view private repositories. You can read more in our [privacy policy](https://about.sourcegraph.com/privacy/).

> NOTE: We are working towards bringing Sourcegraph Cloud to organizations. We are hoping to deliver an early-access version in late fall 2021. Follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sourcegraph) for the latest updates.
