# Sourcegraph Cloud

[Sourcegraph Cloud](https://sourcegraph.com/search) is a public instance of Sourcegraph that lets you search inside any open-source project on GitHub. For demo purposes, you'll be prompted to narrow your query if it would search across more than 50 repositories. To lift this limitation or to search your organization's internal code, [run your own Sourcegraph instance](../../../admin/install/index.md).
