# Sourcegraph Cloud

[Sourcegraph Cloud](https://sourcegraph.com/search) lets you search inside your public code on GitHub or GitLab, and inside any open-source project on GitHub.

Note that you can search across a maximum of 50 repositories at once using Sourcegraph Cloud. To search across more than 50 repositories at once or to search your organization's internal code, [run your own Sourcegraph instance](../../../admin/install/index.md).

Note that **Organizations** feature is disabled in Sourcegraph Cloud. If you want to use it, you also need to [run your own Sourcegraph instance](../../../admin/install/index.md).
