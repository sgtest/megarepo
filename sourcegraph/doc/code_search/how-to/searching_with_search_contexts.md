# Searching across repositories you've added to Sourcegraph with search contexts

Once you've [added repositories to Sourcegraph](adding_repositories_to_cloud.md), you can search across those repositories by default using search contexts.

Sourcegraph Cloud supports two search contexts: 

- Your personal context, `context:@username`, which automatically includes all repositories you add to Sourcegraph.
- The global context, `context:global`, which includes all repositories on Sourcegraph Cloud.

Coming soon: create your own search contexts that include the repositories you choose. Want early access to custom search contexts? [Let us know](mailto:feedback@sourcegraph.com).
