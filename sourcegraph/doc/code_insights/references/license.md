# Licensing and Limited Access

## License 

Instances need a license key with the `code-insights` tag to have full access to Code Insights features. 

## Limited Access 

If an instance does not have full access via the correct license key, then at most, an Enterprise plan instance can have a maximum of two global code insights for "free" without having a license.
