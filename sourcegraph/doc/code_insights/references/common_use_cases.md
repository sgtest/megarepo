# Common Code Insights use cases and recipes

Here are some common use cases for Code Insights and example data series queries you could use. 

For all use cases, you can also explore your insight by [filtering repositories in real time](../how-tos/filtering_an_insight.md) or add any [Sourcegraph search filter](../../../code_search/reference/language.md#search-pattern) to the data series query to filter by language, directory, or content. Currently, the sample queries using commit and diff searches are only supported for insights running over explicit lists of specific repositories. 

*The sample queries below make the assumption you [do not want to search fork or archived](../references/common_reasons_code_insights_may_not_match_search_results.md#not-including-fork-no-and-archived-no-in-your-insight-query) repositories. You can exclude those flags if you do.*

## Migration tracking 

**How many repos yet contain a config or docs file in a specific directory**
```sgquery
select:repo file:docs/*/new_config_file archived:no fork:no
```

**How the switch from files containing “blacklist/whitelist” to “denylist/allowlist" is progressing**
```sgquery
// series 1, decreasing
select:file blacklist OR whitelist archived:no fork:no 
// series 2, increasing
select:file denylist OR allowlist archived:no fork:no 
```

**Tracking migration from global CSS to CSS modules**
```sgquery
// series 1, decreasing
type:file lang:scss -file:module.scss patterntype:regexp archived:no fork:no 
// series 2, increasing
type:file lang:scss file:module.scss patterntype:regexp archived:no fork:no 
```
Note these queries differ only by `-file:` exclusion vs `file:` inclusion – because you can know that all `lang:scss` files are either modules or not.


## Adoption tracking

**How many repos or teams are using a new API your team built**
```sgquery
select:repo ourApiLibrary.load archived:no fork:no
```

**Are more groups or teams using yarn**
```sgquery
select:repo file:yarn.lock archived:no fork:no
```

**Which databases we are calling or writing to most often**
```sgquery
// redis
redis\.set\(.*\) patternType:regexp archived:no fork:no 
// graphQL
graphql\(.*\) patternType:regexp archived:no fork:no
```

**Understand if a growing number of repos import a large/expensive package**
```sgquery
select:repo import\slargePkg\s patternType:regexp archived:no fork:no
```

## Deprecation tracking

**The removal of all deprecated CSS class or icon instances**
```sgquery
2018logo.png archived:no fork:no
```
```sgquery
theme-redesign archived:no fork:no
```

**The progress of deprecating tooling you're moving off of**
```sgquery
slowEventLib.log archived:no fork:no
```
Or you can count how many removals (below) rather than how many remain (above): 
```sgquery
slowEventLib.log type:diff select:commit.diff.removed archived:no fork:no
```

**Deprecating a structural code pattern in favor of a safer pattern** 

Example: do all our tries have catches? This tracks how many do not: 
```sgquery
try {:[_]} catch (:[e]) { } finally {:[_]} lang:java patternType:structural archived:no fork:no
```

## Automatic version and pattern tracking
These examples are all for use with the [automatically generated data series](../explanations/automatically_generated_data_series.md) of "Detect and track" Code Insights, using regular expression capture groups. 

**What Java versions are present or most popular**
```sgquery
file:\.pom$ <java\.version>(.*)</java\.version> archived:no fork:no
```

**What Terraform versions are present or most popular**
```sgquery
app.terraform.io/(.*)\n version =(.*)([0-9].[0-9].[0-9]) lang:Terraform archived:no fork:no
```

**What vulnerable log4j versions are present**
```sgquery
lang:gradle org\.apache\.logging\.log4j['"] 2\.([0-9]+)\. archived:no fork:no
```

**Which python versions are in use or haven't been updated**  
```sgquery
#!/usr/bin/env python([0-9]\.[0-9]+) archived:no fork:no
```

**Which node.js versions are present or most popular**
```sgquery
nvm install ([0-9]+\.[0-9]+) archived:no fork:no
```

**What CSS colors are present or most popular**
```sgquery
color:#([0-9a-fA-f]{3,6}) archived:no fork:no
```

## Code hygiene and health 

**How many TODOs are in a specific part of the codebase (or all of it)** 
```sgquery
TODO archived:no fork:no
```

**How many linter override rules exist**
```sgquery
file:^\.eslintignore .\n patternType:regexp archived:no fork:no
```
(This counts the number of lines, which are file paths to ignore, in .eslintignore files)

**How frequently are there commits with “revert” in the commit message**
```sgquery
type:commit revert archived:no fork:no
```

**How many times are deprecated calls used**
```sgquery
lang:java @deprecated archived:no fork:no
```

**How many repos have CODEOWNERS files** 
```sgquery
\\ how many do:
file:CODEOWNERS select:repo archived:no fork:no
\\ how many don't:
-file:CODEOWNERS select:repo archived:no fork:no
```

## Security vulnerabilities

**Confirm that a vulnerable open source library has been fully removed, or the speed of the deprecation**
```sgquery
vulnerableLib@14.3.9 archived:no fork:no
```

**How quickly we notice and remove API keys when they are committed** 
```sgquery
regexMatchingAPIKey patternType:regexp archived:no fork:no
```

**How often we are merging permissions changes**
```sgquery
type:commit perms|permissions patternType:regexp archived:no fork:no
```

## Codebase Topline Metrics
<!-- > Note that some of these may be very large result sets and perform slower than an average insight.  -->
<!-- 
**Codebase size in LOC (and is it growing/shrinking)** 
```sgquery 
.\n patternType:regex archived:no fork:no
```

**Codebase size for a specific language**
```sgquery 
.\n lang:TypeScript patternType:regex archived:no fork:no
``` -->

**Are there more Typescript or more Go files** 
```sgquery 
select:file lang:TypeScript archived:no fork:no
// vs Go files
select:file lang:Go archived:no fork:no
```

**What number of iOS app screens are in the entire app**
```sgquery
struct : view$ patternType:regexp lang:swift archived:no fork:no
```

## Understanding Code by Team

**Which teams or repos adopted our new events API fastest** 
```sgquery
newEventAPI.call archived:no fork:no
```
And then [filter by repositories](../how-tos/filtering_an_insight.md) in real time. 

**Which teams have the most usage of a problematic API**
```sgquery
// series 1
problemAPI file:teamOneFilePath archived:no fork:no
// series 2
problemAPI file:teamTwoFilePath archived:no fork:no
// ... so on
```
