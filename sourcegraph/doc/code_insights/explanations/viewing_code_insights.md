# Viewing Code Insights

Code Insights can display in 3 areas of Sourcegraph:

- On the insight dashboard pages, which begin with `/insights/dashboards`; enabled by default
- On repository and directly pages for insights that run over that repository; enabled by default
- On the search home page, at `/search`; disabled by default

## Insights dashboards

The main way to view code insights is on a dashboard page. Dashboards have a unique name and visibility level. 

There are three possible visibility levels: 

- Private: visible only to you 
- Shared with an organization: visible to everyone in the organization 
- Global: visible to everyone on the Sourcegraph instance 

> Global visibility is currently only available if your instance is not [using a separate global settings file](../../../admin/config/advanced_config_file.md#global-settings). Global visibility regardless of settings file setup will arrive by October 2021. 

> The **quick workaround** is to [make an organization and easily add all users to it](../../../admin/organizations.md). 

### Built-in dashboards

The following dashboards exist on every instance: 

- "All insights": this dashboard contains all the insights defined on the instance that are visible to this specific user 
- "[Username] insights": this dashboard contains all the insights that are created by a user and set to "private" visibility
- "Global insights": this dashboard contains all the insights that are set to global visibility

If the instance has organizations, there will also be an "[Organization name] insights" dashboard for each organization, visible to members of the organization, that contains all insights set to that organization's visibility level. 

To add insights to your own custom dashboard, see [Creating a custom dashboard of code insights](../how-tos/creating_a_custom_dashboard_of_code_insights.md).

### Dashboard visibility respects insights' visibility 

A Dashboard's visibility level respects the visibility levels you [set when you created the insight](../quickstart.md#7-set-the-visibility-of-your-insight). You can't add an insight with "Private" visibility to an organization dashboard, but you can add an insight with organization visibility to your private dashboard (assuming you're in the organization). 

### Insights still enforce individual permissions regardless of dashboard visibility

The dashboard visibility levels have no impact on the data in the insight itself that is displayed to an individual user: insights [enforce the viewer's permissions](administration_and_security_of_code_insights.md#code-insights-enforce-user-permissions).

This means that two organization users with different repo read permission sets might see different values for the same insights on the same dashboards, if it contains results from a repository only one user can view. 

(This also means that if you change a private-visible dashboard with both organization-visible and private-visible insights so that the dashboard is now visible to an organization, then the organization can only see the organization-visible insights on that dashboard. This is non-optimal and a bit awkward to convey, and we are actively improving this UX. If you have strong thoughts, please do [leave them on the issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/23003).) 

### Insights can be on multiple dashboards

You can attach insights to multiple dashboards. 

## Repository and directory pages

On repository pages, any code insight that runs over that repository will display. On directory pages, code insights defined for that repository will display **and** run only over files that are children of the directory. 

This is enabled by default and can be disabled with a flag in your global, organization, or user settings:

```"insights.displayLocation.directory": false```

## Search home page

Code insights can display below the search bar on the search home page. This is disabled by default because we have not yet built the capability to select which insights display on the search home page (so they all do). This can be enabled with a flag in your global, organization, or user settings: 

```"insights.displayLocation.directory": true```
