# Example: Refactor Go code using Comby

Our goal for this campaign is to simplify Go code by using [Comby](https://comby.dev/) to rewrite statements of this form

```go
fmt.Sprintf("%d", arg)
```

to this form:

```go
strconv.Itoa(arg)
```

The semantics are the same, but one more cleanly expresses the intention behind the code.

We're going to use two Docker containers in our action.

The first container launches Comby to rewrite the Go code.

>NOTE: Learn more about Comby and what it's capable of at [comby.dev](https://comby.dev/)

The second container runs [goimports](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports) to update the `import` statements in the updated Go code so that `strconv` is correctly imported and, possibly, `fmt` is removed.

Here is the `action.json` file that defines this as an action:

```json
{
  "scopeQuery": "lang:go fmt.Sprintf",
  "steps": [
    {
      "type": "docker",
      "image": "comby/comby",
      "args": ["-in-place", "fmt.Sprintf(\"%d\", :[v])", "strconv.Itoa(:[v])", "-matcher", ".go", "-d", "/work"]
    },
    {
      "type": "docker",
      "image": "cytopia/goimports",
      "args": ["-w", "/work"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Please note that the `"scopeQuery"` makes sure that the repositories over which we run the action all contain Go code in which we have a call to `fmt.Sprintf`. That narrows the list of repositories down considerably, even though we still need to search through the whole repository with Comby. (We're aware that this is a limitation and are working on improving the workflows involving exact search results.)

Save the definition in a file, for example `go-comby.action.json`.

Now we can execute the action and turn it into a campaign:

1. Make sure that the `"scopeQuery"` returns the repositories we want to run over:

    ```
    src actions scope-query -f go-comby.action.json
    ```
1. Execute the action and create a patchset:

    ```
    src actions exec -f action.json | src campaign patchset create-from-patches
    ```
1. Follow the printed instructions to create the campaign on Sourcegraph.
