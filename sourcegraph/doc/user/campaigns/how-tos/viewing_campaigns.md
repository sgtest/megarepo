# Viewing campaigns

You can view a list of all campaigns by clicking the <img src="../campaigns-icon.svg" alt="Campaigns icon" /> campaigns icon in the top navigation bar.

Use the filters to switch between showing all campaigns, open campaigns, or closed campaigns.

If you lack read access to a repository in a campaign, you can only see [limited information about the changes to that repository](../explanations/permissions_in_campaigns.md#repository-permissions-for-campaigns).
