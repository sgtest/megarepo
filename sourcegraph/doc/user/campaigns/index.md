# Campaigns

>NOTE: **Campaigns are currently in beta.** We're actively building out the feature set and improving the user experience with every update. Let us know what you think! [File an issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph) with feedback/problems/questions, or [contact us directly](https://about.sourcegraph.com/contact).

## What are Campaigns?

Campaigns are part of [Sourcegraph code change management](https://about.sourcegraph.com/product/code-change-management) and let you make large-scale code changes across many repositories and different code hosts.

You provide the code to make the change and Campaigns provide the plumbing to turn it into a large-scale code change campaign and monitor its progress.

## How it works

Campaigns allow you to use the `src` CLI and leverage Sourcegraph's search powers to execute code and Docker containers in all the repositories yielded by a single search query and save and inspect the produced **patches**.

The created set of patches can then be turned into multiple **changesets** (a generic name for what some code hosts call _pull requests_ and others _merge requests_) on different code hosts by creating a **campaign**.

Once the campaign is created, you can track the review state, CI status and lifecycle of each changeset in the Sourcegraph UI.

See this video for a demonstration of lifecycle of a Campaign:

<div style="max-width: 450px;" class="float-md-right float-none ml-md-3 mx-auto">
  <figure class="figure">
    <div class="figure-img">
      <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/398878670?color=0CB6F4&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="max-height: 250px; width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-right">Campaign: Running <code>gofmt</code> in each repository containing a <code>go.mod</code> file.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

1. With the `src` CLI the user **generates a set of patches** by running `gofmt` over every repository that has a `go.mod` file, leveraging Sourcegraphs search capabilities. This is called **executing an _action_** (an _action_ is a series of commands and Docker containers to run in each repository) and yields **set of patches**, one for each repository, which you can inspect either in the CLI or in the Sourcegraph UI.
1. The patches are then used to **create a draft Campaign**.
1. At this point, since it's a draft Camapaign, no changesets (_pull requests_ in the case of GitHub here) have been created on the code host.
1. The user then selectively **creates GitHub pull requests** by publishing single patches.

## Are you a first time user of Campaigns?

If you are a first-time user of Campaigns, we recommend that you read through the following sections of the documentation:

1. Read through the **How it works** section above and **watch the video** to get an understanding of how Campaigns work.
1. Go through the [**Getting started**](./getting_started.md) instructions to setup your Sourcegraph instance for Campaigns.
1. Create a manual campaign to track the progress of already-existing pull requests on your code host: [**Creating a manual Campaign**](./creating_manual_campaign.md).
1. Create your first campaign from a set of patches by reading [**Creating a Campaign from Patches**](./creating_campaign_from_patches.md).

At this point you're ready to explore some of the [example campaigns](./examples/index.md) and create your own action definitions and campaigns.

## Requirements

* Sourcegraph instance [configured for Campaigns](./configuration.md).
* `src` CLI: [Installation and setup instructions](https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli/#installation)

## Limitations

Campaigns currently only support **GitHub** and **Bitbucket Server** repositories. If you're interested in using Campaigns on other code hosts, [let us know](https://about.sourcegraph.com/contact).
