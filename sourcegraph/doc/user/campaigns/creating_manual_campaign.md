# Creating a manual campaign

Manual campaigns provide the ability to manage and monitor changesets (pull requests) that already exist on code hosts.

In order to create a manual campaign, follow these steps:

1. Go to `/campaigns` on your Sourcegraph instance and click on the **New campaign** button.
1. Click on **Track existing changesets**.
1. Fill in a title for the campaign and a description.
1. Click **Create**.
1. Add changesets by specifying the name of the repository they belong to and their external ID (e.g. the number of a pull request on GitHub) in the **Add changeset** form.
