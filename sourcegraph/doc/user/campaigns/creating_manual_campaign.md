# Creating a manual campaign

Manual campaigns provide the ability to manage and monitor changesets (pull requests) that already exist on code hosts by manually adding them to a campaign.

In order to create a manual campaign, follow these steps:

1. Go to `/campaigns` on your Sourcegraph instance and click on the "New campaign" button.
2. Fill in a name for the campaign and a description.
3. Create the campaign.
4. Track changesets by adding them to the campaign.
