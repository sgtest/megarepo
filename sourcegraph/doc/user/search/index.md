# Code search

<p class="subtitle">Search code across all your repositories and code hosts</p>

[A recently published research paper from Google](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43835.pdf) and a [Google developer survey](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LQxLk4E3lrb3fIsVKlANu_pUjnILteoWMMNiJQmqNVU/edit#heading=h.xxziwxixfqq3) showed that 98% of developers consider their Sourcegraph-like internal code search tool to be critical, and developers use it on average for 5.3 sessions each day, primarily to (in order of frequency):

- find example code
- explore/read code
- debug issues
- determine the impact of changes

Sourcegraph code search helps developers perform these tasks more quickly and effectively by providing fast, advanced code search across multiple repositories.

- [Search features](explanations/features.md)
  - Use regular expressions and exact queries to perform full-text searches.
  - Perform [language-aware structural search](explanations/features.md#language-aware-structural-code-search) on code structure.
  - Search any branch and commit, with no indexing required.
  - Search [commit diffs](explanations/features.md#commit-diff-search) and [commit messages](explanations/features.md#commit-message-search) to see how code has changed.
  - Narrow your search by repository and file pattern.
  - Define saved [search scopes](explanations/features.md#search-scopes) for easier searching.
  - Curate [saved searches](explanations/features.md#saved-searches) for yourself or your org.
  - Set up notifications for code changes that match a query.
  - View [language statistics](explanations/features.md#statistics) for search results.
