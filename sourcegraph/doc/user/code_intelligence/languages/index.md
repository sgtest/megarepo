# How to use these guides

These guides are meant to provide specific instructions to get you producing index data in LSIF as quickly as possible. The [LSIF quick start](../lsif_quickstart.md) and [CI configuration](../adding_lsif_to_workflows.md) guides provide more in depth descriptions of each step and a lot of helpful context that we haven't duplicated in each language guide.
