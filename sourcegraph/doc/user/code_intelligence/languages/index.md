# Language guides

The following guides provide specific instructions for indexing source code and generating LSIF data for a specific language as quickly as possible. The general [quick start](../lsif_quickstart.md) and [CI configuration](../adding_lsif_to_workflows.md) guides are also useful resources that contain additional context and in depth descriptions for each step that can help with advanced implementations.

1. [Go](go.md)
2. [JavaScript/Typescript](typescript_and_javascript.md)
