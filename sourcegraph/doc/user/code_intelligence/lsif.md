# LSIF: Fast and precise code intelligence

[LSIF](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/master/indexFormat/specification.md) is a file format for precomputed code intelligence data. It provides fast and precise code intelligence but needs to be periodically generated and uploaded to your Sourcegraph instance. LSIF is opt-in: repositories for which you have not uploaded LSIF data will continue to use the built-in code intelligence.

> Precise code intelligence using LSIF is supported in Sourcegraph 3.8 and up.

> For users who have a language server deployed, LSIF will take priority over the language server when LSIF data exists for a repository.

## Getting started

Follow our [LSIF quickstart guide](lsif_quickstart.md) to manually generate and upload LSIF data for your repository. After you are satisfied with the result, you can upload LSIF data to a Sourcegraph instance using your existing [continuous integration infrastructure](adding_lsif_to_workflows.md#lsif-in-continuous-integration), or using [GitHub Action](adding_lsif_to_workflows.md#lsif-on-github).

LSIF support is still a relatively new feature. We are currently working on validating that the feature remains responsive even with tens of thousands of repositories. To get started, we recommend you upload a smaller number of key repositories. Once you reach 50 to 100 repositories, we will be able to provide specific recommendations for ensuring stability and performance of your Sourcegraph instance.

## Enabling LSIF on your Sourcegraph instance

Go to your global settings at https://sourcegraph.example.com/site-admin/global-settings and enable LSIF:

```json
  "codeIntel.lsif": true
```

After uploading LSIF files, your Sourcegraph instance will use these files to respond to code intelligence requests (such as for hovers, definitions, and references). When LSIF data does not exist for a particular file in a repository, Sourcegraph will fall back to built-in code intelligence.

## Why are my results sometimes incorrect?

You may occasionally see results from [basic code intelligence](basic_code_intelligence.md) even when you have uploaded LSIF data. Such results are indicated with a ![tooltip](img/basic-code-intel-tooltip.svg) tooltip. This can happen in the following scenarios:

- The symbol has LSIF data, but it is defined in a repository which does not have LSIF data.
- The nearest commit that has LSIF data is too far away from your browsing commit. [The limit is 100 commits](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/e7803474dbac8021e93ae2af930269045aece079/lsif/src/shared/constants.ts#L25) ahead/behind.
- The line containing the symbol was created or edited between the nearest indexed commit and the commit being browsed.
- The _Find references_ panel will always include search-based results, but only after all of the precise results have been displayed. This ensures every symbol has code intelligence.

## Cross-repository code intelligence

Cross-repository code intelligence will only be powered by LSIF when **both** repositories have LSIF data. When the current file has LSIF data and the other repository doesn't, the missing precise results will be supplemented with imprecise search-based code intelligence.

## Size of upload data

The following table gives a rough estimate for the space and time requirements for indexing and conversion. These repositories are a representative sample of public Go repositories available on GitHub. The working tree size is the size of the clone at the given commit (without git history), the number of files indexed, and the number of lines of Go code in the repository. The index size gives the size of the uncompressed LSIF output of the indexer. The conversion size gives the total amount of disk space occupied after uploading the dump to a Sourcegraph instance.

## Data retention policy

The bulk of LSIF data is stored on-disk, and as code intelligence data for a commit ages it becomes less useful. Sourcegraph will automatically remove the least recently uploaded data if the amount of used disk space exceeds a configurable threshold. This value defaults to 10 GiB (10â¨‰2^30 = 10737418240  bytes), and can be changed via the `DBS_DIR_MAXIMUM_SIZE_BYTES` environment variable.
