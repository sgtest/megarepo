# LSIF

[LSIF](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/master/indexFormat/specification.md) is a file format for precomputed code intelligence data. It provides fast and precise code intelligence, but needs to be periodically generated and uploaded to your Sourcegraph instance. LSIF is opt-in: repositories for which you have not uploaded LSIF data will continue to use the out-of-the-box code intelligence.

> LSIF is supported in Sourcegraph 3.8 and up.

> For users who have a language server deployed, LSIF will take priority over the language server when LSIF data exists for a repository.

## Generating and uploading LSIF data

You can upload LSIF data to a Sourcegraph instance using your existing [continuous integration infrastructure](./lsif_in_ci.md), or using [GitHub Actions](./lsif_on_github.md).

## Enabling LSIF

Go to your global settings at https://sourcegraph.example.com/site-admin/global-settings and enable LSIF:

```json
  "codeIntel.lsif": true
```

After uploading LSIF files, your Sourcegraph instance will use these files to power code intelligence so that when you visit a file in that repository on your Sourcegraph instance, the code intelligence should be more precise than it was out-of-the-box.

When LSIF data does not exist for a particular file in a repository, Sourcegraph will fall back to out-of-the-box code intelligence.

## Stale code intelligence

LSIF code intelligence will be out-of-sync when you're viewing a file that has changed since the LSIF data was uploaded.

## Warning about uploading too much data

Global find-references is a resource-intensive operation that's sensitive to the number of packages for which you have uploaded LSIF data into your Sourcegraph instance. Improvements to this are planned for Sourcegraph 3.10 (see the [RFC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VZB0Y4tWKeOUN1JvdDgo4LHwQn875MPOI9xztzqoSRc/edit#)).

**Do not upload more than 10-40 LSIF dumps to Sourcegraph instance or you risk harming other parts of Sourcegraph. We are working to validate its performance at scale and eliminate this concern.**
