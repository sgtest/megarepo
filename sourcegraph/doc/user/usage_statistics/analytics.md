# Usage analytics

Sourcegraph records basic usage statistics for site admins. To view analytics, visit the **Site admin > Analytics** page. (The URL is `https://sourcegraph.example.com/site-admin/analytics`.)

Here you can see charts with counts of unique users by day, week, or month, split into authenticated and anonymous users.

From this page, you can also see user-level activity, including counts of pageviews, searches, and code intelligence actions, and last active times. This user-level data is all stored locally on your Sourcegraph instance, and is never sent to Sourcegraph.com.
