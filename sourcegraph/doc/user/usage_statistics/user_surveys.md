## User surveys

After using Sourcegraph for a few days, users are presented with a request to answer "How likely is it that you would recommend Sourcegraph to a friend?", and to provide some qualitative product feedback.

Responses to this survey are visible to all site admins on the Sourcegraph instance. View all responses on the **Site admin > User surveys** page. (The URL is `https://sourcegraph.example.com/site-admin/surveys`.)

On this page, admins can view individual satisfaction scores (from 0â€“10) and individual qualitative feedback, along with aggregate historical scores.

Survey responses are also always sent to Sourcegraph.com.
