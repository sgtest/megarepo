# Sourcegraph Enterprise vs. Sourcegraph OSS

Sourcegraph offers two versions of its product: Sourcegraph Open Source (Sourcegraph OSS) and Sourcegraph Enterprise. 

Sourcegraph Enterprise is Sourcegraph’s primary offering and includes all code intelligence platform features, like:

- Code Search
- Code navigation
- Batch Changes
- Code Insights

See the [detailed feature comparison](#detailed-feature-comparison) for a list of all features.

Sourcegraph Enterprise is the best solution for enterprises who want to use Sourcegraph with their organization’s code. Sourcegraph Enterprise is available via our [paid plans](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing). Teams of up to 10 developers can use a limited version of Sourcegraph Enterprise for free.

Sourcegraph OSS only includes universal code search functionality and does not include any [code intelligence platform](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/code-search-to-code-intelligence) or enterprise features. Sourcegraph OSS does **not** include:

- Code navigation
- Batch Changes
- Code Insights
- Code monitoring
- Notebooks
- SSO
- Browser/IDE extensions
- And [more](#detailed-feature-comparison) 

Sourcegraph OSS is built as a single container which limits scalability. 

Check out our [handbook](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/engineering/product/process/gtm/licensing/) for additional details on Sourcegraph OSS. 

## Getting started
Sourcegraph Enterprise can be run in a variety of environments, from cloud to self-hosted to your local machine. For most customers, we recommend [Sourcegraph Cloud](https://about.sourcegraph.com/get-started?t=enterprise/), managed entirely by Sourcegraph. Visit the [get started](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/#get-started) section of the docs for details on every deployment option.

Developers can use [Sourcegraph OSS](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph) without agreeing to any enterprise licensing terms by building their own server image. If they do so, no code from our enterprise-licensed features will be included in their Sourcegraph deployment.

In practice, Sourcegraph OSS involves:

- Removing the enterprise directories from the repository
- Building your own docker image (you can’t just use ours)
