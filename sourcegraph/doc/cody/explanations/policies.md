# Auto-indexing

## Embeddings Policies

Embedding policies define which repositories are automatically scheduled for embedding.

## How to create an embeddings policy

Policies are created by administrators from the _Site Admin_ page.
Open the _Site Admin_ page and select **Cody > Embedding Policies** from the left-hand navigation menu.

The page shows a list of all existing embedding policies.
Click the **Create new global policy** button to create a new policy.
Provide a descriptive name for the policy and click on **Add repository pattern** to define a pattern.

The pattern matches exactly, unless you use an asterisk _*_ to match any sequence of characters.
The policy will be applied to all repositories that match the pattern.
If you choose not to define a pattern, the policy will be applied to up to [embeddings.policyRepositoryMatchLimit](./code_graph_context.md#configuring-the-global-policy-match-limit) repositories.
Finally, click on **Create policy**.
The new policy will be shown in the list of policies.

## Lifecycle of an embeddings policy

Once a policy has been created, it is active.
To deactivate a policy, simply delete it.
A worker process periodically checks the embeddings policies and resolves them into a list of repositories to index.
Another worker then creates a new index job for each repository and queues it for processing.
A repository cannot be queued for processing if

- it is already queued or being processed
- a job for the same repository and the same revision already completed successfully
- if another job for the same repository has been queued for processing within the [embeddings.MinimumInterval](./code_graph_context.md#adjust-the-minimum-time-interval-between-automatically-scheduled-embeddings) time window

All embeddings jobs are listed under **Cody > Embeddings Jobs**
