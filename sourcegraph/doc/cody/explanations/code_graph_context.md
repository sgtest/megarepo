# Code graph context

Code graph context is Cody's ability to respond to queries using contextual information of a codebase. We recommend configuring code graph context for the best Cody experience.

## Relevant code files

Cody reads relevant code files to increase the accuracy and quality of the response and make it match your own codebase's conventions. There are 2 ways Cody can find relevant code files: embeddings (preferred) and local keyword-based search.

### Embeddings

Embeddings are a semantic representation of text that allow us to create a search index over an entire codebase. The process of creating embeddings involves us splitting the entire codebase into searchable chunks and sending them to the external service specified in the site config for embedding. The final embedding index is stored in a managed object storage service.

Embeddings for relevant code files must be enabled for each repository that you'd like Cody to have context on.

### Configuring embeddings

> NOTE: By default, no embeddings are created. Admins must choose which code is sent to the
> third party LLM for embedding (currently OpenAI). Once Sourcegraph provides first party embeddings,
> embeddings will be enabled for all repositories by default.

Embeddings are automatically enabled and configured once [Cody is enabled](../quickstart.md). You can also [use third-party embeddings provider directly](#using-a-third-party-embeddings-provider-directly) for embeddings.

Embeddings will not be generated for any repo unless an admin takes action. There are two ways to do this.

The recommended way of configuring embeddings is to use a policy. These are configured through the Admin UI using [policies](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/cody/explanations/policies). Policy based embeddings will be automatically updated based on the [update interval](#adjust-the-minimum-time-interval-between-automatically-scheduled-embeddings).

 Admins can also [schedule one-time embeddings jobs for specific repositories](./schedule_one_off_embeddings_jobs.md). These one-off embeddings will not be automatically updated.

Whether created manually or through a policy, embeddings will be generated incrementally if [incremental updates](#incremental-embeddings) are enabled.

> NOTE: Generating embeddings sends code snippets to a third-party language party provider. By enabling Cody, you agree to the [Cody Notice and Usage Policy](https://about.sourcegraph.com/terms/cody-notice).

### Filtering files from embeddings

`fileFilters` is a setting in the Sourcegraph embeddings configuration that allows you to filter file paths meeting certain conditions from being used in generating embeddings. By specifying glob patterns in `excludedFilePathPatterns` and `includedFilePathPatterns` that match file paths, you can exclude files that have low information value, such as test fixtures, mocks, auto-generated files, and other files that are not relevant to the codebase.

To use `fileFilters`, add it to your embeddings site config. 

For example, to: exclude all files under `node_modules`, include only .go files, and limiting the maximum file size to 300KB, you would add the following setting to your configuration file:

```json
{
  // [...]
  "embeddings": {
    // [...]
    "fileFilters": {
      "excludedFilePathPatterns": [
        "node_modules/"
      ],
      "includedFilePathPatterns": [
        "*.go"
      ],
      "maxFileSizeBytes": 300000 //300 KB
    }
  }
}
```

By default, the following patterns are excluded from embeddings:

- *ignore" // Files like .gitignore, .eslintignore
- .gitattributes
- .mailmap
- *.csv
- *.svg
- *.xml
- \_\_fixtures\_\_/
- node_modules/
- testdata/
- mocks/
- vendor/

> NOTE: The `excludedFilePathPatterns` setting is only available in Sourcegraph version `5.0.1` and later.

### Storing embedding indexes

To target a managed object storage service, you will need to set a handful of environment variables for configuration and authentication to the target service. **If you are running a sourcegraph/server deployment, set the environment variables on the server container. Otherwise, if running via Docker-compose or Kubernetes, set the environment variables on the `frontend`, `embeddings`, and `worker` containers.**

#### Using S3

To target an S3 bucket you've already provisioned, set the following environment variables. Authentication can be done through [an access and secret key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys) (and optional session token), or via the EC2 metadata API.

**_Warning:_** Remember never to commit aws access keys in git. Consider using a secret handling service offered by your cloud provider. 

- `EMBEDDINGS_UPLOAD_BACKEND=S3`
- `EMBEDDINGS_UPLOAD_BUCKET=<my bucket name>`
- `EMBEDDINGS_UPLOAD_AWS_ENDPOINT=https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
- `EMBEDDINGS_UPLOAD_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your access key>`
- `EMBEDDINGS_UPLOAD_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your secret key>`
- `EMBEDDINGS_UPLOAD_AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<your session token>` (optional)
- `EMBEDDINGS_UPLOAD_AWS_USE_EC2_ROLE_CREDENTIALS=true` (optional; set to use EC2 metadata API over static credentials)
- `EMBEDDINGS_UPLOAD_AWS_REGION=us-east-1` (default)

**_Note:_** If a non-default region is supplied, ensure that the subdomain of the endpoint URL (_the `AWS_ENDPOINT` value_) matches the target region.

> NOTE: You don't need to set the `EMBEDDINGS_UPLOAD_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` environment variable when using `EMBEDDINGS_UPLOAD_AWS_USE_EC2_ROLE_CREDENTIALS=true` because role credentials will be automatically resolved. 

#### Using GCS

To target a GCS bucket you've already provisioned, set the following environment variables. Authentication is done through a service account key, supplied as either a path to a volume-mounted file, or the contents read in as an environment variable payload.

- `EMBEDDINGS_UPLOAD_BACKEND=GCS`
- `EMBEDDINGS_UPLOAD_BUCKET=<my bucket name>`
- `EMBEDDINGS_UPLOAD_GCP_PROJECT_ID=<my project id>`
- `EMBEDDINGS_UPLOAD_GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_FILE=</path/to/file>`
- `EMBEDDINGS_UPLOAD_GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_FILE_CONTENT=<{"my": "content"}>`

#### Provisioning buckets

If you would like to allow your Sourcegraph instance to control the creation and lifecycle configuration management of the target buckets, set the following environment variables:

- `EMBEDDINGS_UPLOAD_MANAGE_BUCKET=true`

### Environment variables for the `embeddings` service

- `EMBEDDINGS_CACHE_SIZE`: The maximum size of the in-memory cache that holds the embeddings for commonly-searched repos. If embeddings for a repo are larger than this size, the repo will not be held in the cache and must be re-fetched for each embeddings search. Defaults to `6GiB`.

### Incremental embeddings

Incremental embeddings allow you to update the embeddings for a repository without having to re-embed the entire
repository. With incremental embeddings, outdated embeddings of deleted and modified files are removed and new
embeddings of the modified and added files are added to the repository's embeddings. This speeds up updates, reduces the
data sent to the embedding provider and saves costs.

Incremental embeddings are enabled by default. You can disable incremental embeddings by setting
the `incremental` property in the embeddings configuration to `false`.

```json
{
  // [...]
  "embeddings": {
    // [...]
    "incremental": false
  }
}
```

### Adjust the minimum time interval between automatically scheduled embeddings

If you configure a repository for automated embeddings, the repository will be scheduled for embedding with every new
commit. By default, there is a 24-hour time interval that must pass between two embeddings. For example, if a repository
is scheduled for embedding at 10:00 AM and a new commit happens at 11:00 AM, the next embedding will be scheduled
earliest for 10:00 AM the next day.

You can configure the minimum time interval by setting the minimumInterval property in the embeddings configuration.
Supported time units are h (hours), m ( minutes), and s (seconds).

```json
{
  // [...]
  "embeddings": {
    // [...]
    "minimumInterval": "24h"
  }
}
```

### Using a third-party embeddings provider directly

Instead of [Sourcegraph Cody Gateway](./cody_gateway.md), you can configure Sourcegraph to use a third-party provider directly for embeddings. Currently, this can be one of
- OpenAI
- Azure OpenAI <span class="badge badge-experimental">Experimental</span>

#### OpenAI

First, you must create your own key with OpenAI [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys). Once you have the key, go to **Site admin > Site configuration** (`/site-admin/configuration`) on your instance and set:

```jsonc
{
  // [...]
  "cody.enabled": true,
  "embeddings": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "accessToken": "<token>",
    "excludedFilePathPatterns": []
  }
}
```

#### Azure OpenAI <span class="badge badge-experimental">Experimental</span>

> NOTE: Azure OpenAI support is highly experimental. We do not recommend using it in a production setting. 

First, make sure you created a project in the Azure OpenAI portal. 

From the project overview, go to **Keys and Endpoint** and grab **one of the keys** on that page, and the **endpoint**.

Next, under **Model deployments** click "manage deployments" and make sure you deploy the models you want to use. For example, `text-embedding-ada-002`. Take note of the **deployment name**.

Once done, go to **Site admin > Site configuration** (`/site-admin/configuration`) on your instance and set:

```jsonc
{
  "cody.enabled": true,
  "embeddings": {
    "provider": "azure-openai",
    "model": "<deployment name of the model>",
    "endpoint": "<endpoint>",
    "accessToken": "<key>",
    "dimensions": 1536,
    "excludedFilePathPatterns": []
  }
}
```

### Disabling embeddings

Embeddings can currently be disabled, even with Cody enabled, using the following site configuration:

```jsonc
{
  "embeddings": { "enabled": false }
}
```

### Configuring the global policy match limit

By default, a global policy, that means an embeddings policy without a pattern, is applied to up to 5000 repositories. 
The repositories matching the policy are first sorted by star count (descending) and id (descending) and then the first 5000 repositories are selected.
You can configure the limit by setting the `policyRepositoryMatchLimit` property in the embeddings configuration.

A negative value disables the limit and all repositories are selected.

```json
{
  // [...]
  "embeddings": {
    // [...]
    "policyRepositoryMatchLimit": 5000
  }
}
```

### Limitting the number of embeddings that can be generated

The number of embeddings that can be generated per repo is limited to `embeddings.maxCodeEmbeddingsPerRepo` for code embeddings (default 3.072.000) or `embeddings.maxTextEmbeddingsPerRepo` (default 512.000) for text embeddings.

Use the following site configuration to update the limits:

```jsonc
{
  "embeddings": {
    "maxCodeEmbeddingsPerRepo": 3072000,
    "maxTextEmbeddingsPerRepo": 512000
  }
}
```
