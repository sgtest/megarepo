# Enabling Cody with Sourcegraph.com

Cody uses Sourcegraph to fetch relevant context to generate answers and code. These instructions walk through installing Cody and connecting it to Sourcegraph.com. For private instances of Sourcegraph, see [this page about enabling Cody for Enterprise](enabling_cody_enterprise.md).

## Initial setup

1. [Create a Sourcegraph.com account](https://sourcegraph.com/sign-up)
2. Install [the Cody VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.cody-ai)
3. Open the Cody extension in your editor and sign in with your Sourcegraph.com credentials
4. When prompted by the extesnion, set the Sourcegraph URL to `https://sourcegraph.com`

You're now ready to use Cody in VS Code!

## Configure code graph context for code-aware answers

After installing, you can optionally use [code graph context](code_graph_context.md) to improve Cody's context of existing code. Note that code graph context is only available for public repositories on sourcegraph.com which have embeddings. [See the list](../embedded-repos.md) of repositories with embeddings and request any that you'd like to add by pinging a Sourcegraph team member in [Discord](https://discord.gg/8wJF5EdAyA).

If you want to use Cody with code graph context on private code, consider moving to a Sourcegraph Enterprise instance.

### Enable code graph context

The `Cody: Codebase` setting in VS Code enables codebase-aware answers for the Cody extension. By setting this configuration option to the name of a repository with embeddings, Cody will be able to provide more accurate and relevant answers to your coding questions based on that repository's content.

- Open the VS Code workspace settings by pressing <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl+,</kbd>, (or File > Preferences (Settings) on Windows & Linux).
- Search for the `Cody: Codebase` setting.
- Enter the repository name.
  - For example: `github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph` without the `https` protocol
