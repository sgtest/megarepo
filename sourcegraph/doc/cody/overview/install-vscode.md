    <p>Install Cody's free extension for VS Code.</p>
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>

## Prerequisites

- You have the latest version of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed
- You have enabled an instance for [Cody from your Sourcegraph.com](cody-with-sourcegraph.md) account

## Install the VS Code extension

Follow these steps to install the Cody AI extension for VS Code:

- Open VS Code editor on your local machine
- Click the **Extensions** icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code, or use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd+Shift+X` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux)
- Type **Cody AI** in the search bar and click the **Install** button
- After installing, you may be prompted to reload VS Code to activate the extension

![install-vscode-extension](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/install-cody-vscode.png)

Alternatively, you can also [download and install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace][cody-vscode-marketplace] directly.

## Connect the extension to Sourcegraph

After a successful installation, the Cody icon appears in the [Activity sidebar](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/ux-guidelines/activity-bar). Users on free Cody tier can sign in to their Sourcegraph.com accounts through GitHub, GitLab, or Google.

![cody-sign-flow](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/cody-new-ui.png)

You can use Sourcegraph Enterprise with the Cody VS Code extension. Click the **Sign In to Your Enterprise Instance**, and it connects to your enterprise environment. For Enterprise users, please sign in with your custom Sourcegraph instance URL and access token. Enterprise accounts are not compatible with community accounts.

## Verifying the installation

Once connected, click the Cody icon from the sidebar again. The Cody extension will open in a configurable side panel.

![code-panel](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/cody-new-panel.png)

Let's create an autocomplete suggestion to verify that the Cody extension has been successfully installed and is working as expected.

Cody provides intelligent code suggestions and context-aware autocompletions for numerous programming languages like JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, Go, etc.

- Create a new file in VS Code, for example, `code.js`
- Next, type the following algorithm function to sort an array of numbers

```js
function bubbleSort(array){
```

- As you start typing, Cody will automatically provide suggestions and context-aware completions based on your coding patterns and the code context
- These autocomplete suggestions appear as grayed text. To accept the suggestion, press the `Tab` key

</video>

## Chat

Cody chat in VS Code is available in a tab next to your code. Once connected to Sourcegraph, a **New Chat** button opens the chat window on the right. You can have multiple Cody Chats going simultaneously in separate tabs.

All previous and existing chats are stored under the chats panel on the left. You can download these to share or use later in a `.json` file, or delete them altogether.

### Enhanced Context Selector

Cody's Enhanced Context enables Cody to leverage search and embeddings-based context. Community users can generate local embeddings for their projects by clicking the icon next to the chat input. Users can also disable Enhanced Context to have more granular control of Cody's context by including `@-files` or `@#-symbols` in the chat input.

**Note: Embeddings for Enterprise users are controlled by their administrators.**

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/CleanShot%202023-12-07%20at%2018.58.40%402x.png)

The following tables shows what happens when Enhanced Context Selection is enabled or disabled.

|                          | Opened Files                 | Highlighted Code            | Embeddings (If available)  | Search (as backup)            |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Enhanced Context Enabled  | ✅                           | ✅                          | ✅                          | ✅                          |
| Enhanced Context Disabled | ❌                           | ❌                          | ❌                          | ❌                          |


### LLM Selection

Cody Community users can choose the LLM they'd like Cody to use for chats right within the chat panel. The default LLM is set to Claude 2.0 by Anthropic, but the drop-down allows you to experiment with different LLMs and choose the one that's best for you. For Enterprise users, the LLM is determined by the administrator and cannot be changed within the editor.

## Commands

Cody offers quick, ready-to-use [Commands](./../capabilities.md#commands) for common actions to write, describe, fix, and smell code. These allow you to run predefined actions with smart context-fetching anywhere in the editor, like:

- Ask Cody a question
- Add code documentation
- Edit code with instructions
- Explain code
- Identify code smells
- Generate unit tests
- Custom commands

Let's understand how the `/doc` command generates code documentation for a function.

  <source src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/Media/code-comments-cody.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

In addition, you can also select which files and symbols to add as additional context. Type `@` to include files of your choice. Currently, only local files are available for this feature to work.

The file paths are relative to your workspace, and you can start with the root folder and type out the rest of the path, for example `src/util/<YOUR-FILE>`.

### Custom commands

In addition, to support customization and advanced use cases, you can create **Custom commands** tailored to your requirements. Custom commands are currently supported by Cody for the VS Code extension version 0.8 and above.


## Cody VS Code actions

Cody VS Code extension users can also use the **Code Actions** feature to `fix`, `explain`, and `edit` code. These Code Actions are triggered by the following:

- Ask Cody to Fix
- Ask Cody to Explain
- Ask Cody to Edit

These Code Actions can be initiated by clicking the **lightbulb** icon in your code file. For example, whenever there's an error in code syntax, and you make a mistake while writing code, Cody's Code Actions come into play, and a red warning triggers. Along this appears the lightbulb icon. Click this lightbulb icon in the project file.

- Select **Ask Cody to fix** option
- **Cody is working** notice will appear and provide a quick fix with options for **Edits Applied**, **Retry**, **Undo**, and **Done**
- If you are satisfied with the fix, click **Edits Applied**
- To verify the applied changes, you can see a diff view of the fix in a new tab
- If you are not satisfied with the fix, you can **Retry** or **Undo** the changes

Here's a demo that shows how Code Actions work to fix an error:

<video width="1920" height="1080" loop playsinline controls style="width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: 50rem">
  <source src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/Media/code-actions.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

A similar process applies to explain and edit Code Actions.

## Cody Natural Language Search

<aside class="beta">
<p>
<span class="badge badge-beta">Experimental</span>
Cody Natural Language Search is currently available in Experimental for all users on VS Code extension.
</p>
</aside>

The **Natural Language Search** is an AI-powered code search that allows users to input a natural language search query and look for it within their project. For example, "password hashing" or "connection retries".

In the left-hand panel, type your queries in the **Search** field, and the search results are displayed. You can select one of the search results and verify that the correct file opens in a new tab. Natural Language Search works for all Cody users with the ability to search across your entire local codebase from within the IDE.

## Enable code graph context for context-aware answers (Optional)

After connecting Cody's extension to Sourcegraph.com, you can optionally use [Code Graph Context](./../core-concepts/code-graph.md) to improve Cody's context of existing code. Code Graph Context is only available for public repositories on Sourcegraph.com, which have embeddings.

You can view the [list of repositories with embeddings here](../embedded-repos.md). To add any of these to your dev environment, contact a Sourcegraph team member via [Discord](https://discord.gg/8wJF5EdAyA) to get help with the access and setup.

To use Cody with code graph on private code, it's recommended to [enable Cody for Enterprise](enable-cody-enterprise.md).

### Configure code graph context

The `Cody: Codebase` setting in VS Code enables codebase-aware answers for the Cody extension. Enter the repository's name with embeddings, and Cody can provide more accurate and relevant answers to your coding questions based on that repository's content. To configure this setting in VS Code:

- Open the **Cody Extension Settings**
- Search for the `Cody: Codebase`
- Enter the repository name
- For example: `github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph` without the `https` protocol
