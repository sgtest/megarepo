# Installing Cody in VS Code

<p class="subtitle">Learn how to use Cody and its features with the VS Code editor.</p>

The Cody AI extension by Sourcegraph enhances your coding experience in VS Code by providing intelligent code sugsgestions, context-aware completions, and advanced code analysis. This guide will walk you through the steps to install and set up the Cody within your VS Code environment.

    <h3><img alt="VS Code" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/docs/images/cody/vscode.svg"/> Cody: VS Code Extension</h3>
    <p>Install Cody's free and open source extension for VS Code.</p>
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>

## Prerequisites

- You have the latest version of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed
- You have enabled an instance for [Cody from your Sourcegraph.com](cody-with-sourcegraph.md) account

## Install the VS Code extension

Follow these steps to install the Cody AI extension for VS Code:

- Open VS Code editor on your local machine
- Click the "Extensions" icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code, or use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd+Shift+X` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux)
- Type "Cody AI" in the search bar and press "Enter"
- Click on the "Install" button next to the "Cody AI" by Sourcegraph
- After installing the extension, you may be prompted to restart VS Code to activate the extension

Alternatively, you can also [download and install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace][cody-vscode-marketplace] directly.

## Connect the extension to Sourcegraph

After a successful installation, Cody's icon appears in the side bar. When you click it, you're asked to either "Download the Cody App" or use "Other Sign In Options…" to connect to a Sourcegraph instance.

You can connect either an enterprise instance or Sourcegraph.com via the following ways:

- Sign in to Sourcegraph Enterprise instance
- Sign in to Sourcegraph Enterprise instance via Access Token
- Sign in to Sourcegraph.com
- Sign in with URL and Access Token
- Sourcegraph.com

### For Sourcegraph enterprise users

Log in to your Sourcegraph instance and go to `settings` / `access token` (`https://<your-instance>.sourcegraph.com/users/<your-instance>/settings/tokens`). From here, generate a new access token.

Then, you will paste your access token and instance address in to the Cody extension.

### For Sourcegraph.com users

Click `Continue with Sourcegraph.com` in the Cody extension. From there, you'll be taken to Sourcegraph.com, which will authenticate your extension.

## Verifying the installation

Once connected, click the Cody icon from the sidebar again, and a panel will open. To verify that the Cody AI extension has been successfully installed and is working as expected:

- Open a file in a supported programming language like JavaScript, Python, Go, etc.
- As you start typing, Cody AI should begin providing intelligent suggestions and context-aware completions based on your coding patterns and the context of your code

## Commands

Cody also supports executing reusable prompts known as **Commands** from within the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.cody-ai). They allow you to run predefined actions (like `Explain Selected Code` and `Generate Unit Tests` for example) with smart context-fetching anywhere in the editor.

[Learn more about Commands here →](./../capabilities.md#commands)

## Enable code graph context for context-aware answers (Optional)

You can optionally configure code graph content, which gives Cody the ability to provide context-aware answers. For example, Cody can write example API calls if has context of a codebase's API schema.

Learn more about how to:

- [Configure code graph context for Sourcegraph.com][cody-with-sourcegraph-config-graph]
- [Configure code graph context for Sourcegraph Enterprise][enable-cody-enterprise-config-graph]

## Updating the extension

VS Code will typically notify you when updates are available for installed extensions. Follow the prompts to update the Cody AI extension to the latest version.
