      <p>Install Cody's free and open source extension for JetBrains.</p>
    </a>
  </li>
  </ul>

## Prerequisites

- You have the latest version of <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank">JetBrains IntelliJ</a> installed
- You have enabled an instance for [Cody from your Sourcegraph.com](cody-with-sourcegraph.md) account

## Install the JetBrains IntelliJ Cody extension

Follow these steps to install the Cody extension for JetBrains IntelliJ:

- Open JetBrains IntelliJ editor on your local machine
- Open "Settings" (Mac: `⌘+,` Windows: `Ctrl+Alt+S`) and select "Plugins"
- Type and search "Cody AI by Sourcegraph" extension and click "Install"

Alternatively, you can also [Download and install the extension from the Jetbrains marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9682-sourcegraph).

## Connect the extension to Sourcegraph

After a successful installation, Cody's icon appears in the sidebar. Click it, and you are prompted to log in as a free user by connecting to Sourcegraph.com or with your enterprise instance.

Cody fully understands your codebase context based on the project opened in your workspace. However, at any point, you can override the automatic “codebase detection” by clicking on the repo name below the Cody chat and then adding the Git URL.

![override-codebase-context](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/Docs/override-code-context.png)

### For Sourcegraph enterprise users

Log in to your Sourcegraph instance and go to `settings` / `access token` (`https://<your-instance>.sourcegraph.com/users/<your-username>/settings/tokens`). From here, generate a new access token.

Then, you select the option to `Use an enterprise instance` and you will paste your access token and instance URL address in to the Cody extension.

### For Sourcegraph.com users

Click `Continue with Sourcegraph.com` in the Cody extension. From there, you'll be taken to Sourcegraph.com, which will authenticate your extension.

## Embeddings

For free users, embeddings are supported for the open source repos on Sourcegraph.com. Enterprise users are guided to contact their admin for a more customized embeddings experience.

## Verifying the installation

Once connected, click the Cody icon from the sidebar again, and a panel will open. To verify that the Cody extension has been successfully installed and is working as expected:

- Open a file in a supported programming language like JavaScript, Python, Go, etc.
- As you start typing, Cody should begin providing intelligent suggestions and context-aware completions based on your coding patterns and the context of your code

## Commands

The Cody JetBrains IntelliJ extension also supports pre-built reusable prompts called "Commands" that help you quickly get started with common programming tasks like:

- Explain code
- Generate unit test
- Generate docstring
- Improve variable names
- Translate to different language
- Summarize recent code changes
- Detect code smells
- Generate release notes

## Autocomplete

Autocomplete suggestions appear as inlay suggestions. Press `Option+\` (for macOS) or `Alt+\` (for Windows) to manually trigger the autocomplete. Press `tab` to accept a suggestion and `Escape` to reject it.

Autocomplete is triggered by default. You can disable the automatic trigger optionally through the Cody icon in the status bar or from the Cody Settings.

In addition, autocomplete suggestions use the same color as inline parameter hints according to your configured theme. You can optionally customize this color from the Cody settings.

## Supported JetBrains IDEs

The Cody plugin works with all JetBrains IDEs, including:

- IntelliJ IDEA
- IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
- PhpStorm
- WebStorm
- PyCharm
- PyCharm Community Edition
- RubyMine
- AppCode
- CLion
- GoLand
- DataGrip
- Rider
- Android Studio

## Enable code graph context for context-aware answers (optional)

You can optionally configure code graph content, which gives Cody the ability to provide context-aware answers. For example, Cody can write example API calls if has context of a codebase's API schema.

Learn more about how to:

- [Configure code graph context for Sourcegraph.com](cody-with-sourcegraph.md#configure-code-graph-context-for-code-aware-answers)
- [Configure code graph context for Sourcegraph Enterprise](enable-cody-enterprise.md#enabling-codebase-aware-answers)

## Updating the extension

JetBrains IntelliJ will typically notify you when updates are available for installed extensions. Follow the prompts to update the Cody extension to the latest version.
