# Core concepts

Code monitors allow you to keep track of and get notified about changes in your code. Some use cases for code monitors include getting notifications for potential secrets, anti-patterns, or common typos committed to your codebase.

Code monitors are made up of two main elements: **Triggers** and **Actions**.

## Triggers

A _trigger_ is an event which causes execution of an action. Currently, the only trigger supported is when new search results are detected for a particular search query. When creating a code monitor, users will be asked to specify a query as part of the trigger. 

Sourcegraph will run the search query perioidcally, and when new results for the query are detected, a trigger event is executed. In response to the trigger event, any _actions_ attached to the code monitor will be executed.

**Query requirements**

A query that is defined as a trigger must be a diff or commit search. In other words, the query must contain `type:commit` or `type:diff`. This allows Sourcegraph to detect new search results periodically.

## Actions

An _action_ is executed in response to a trigger event. Currently, the only action supported is sending a notification email to the owner of the code monitor.

In response to a trigger event, Sourcegraph will send an email containing a link to the newly detected results to the owner of the code monitor.

## Current flow

To put it all together, a code monitor defined today would have a flow similar to the following: 

A user creates a code monitor, which consists of: 
  * a name for the monitor
  * a trigger, which consists of a search query to run periodically,
  * and an action, which is sending an email to the user when new results appear

Sourcegraph runs the query perioidcally. When new results are detected, an email is sent to the user that created the monitor. The email contains a link to the newly detected search results.
