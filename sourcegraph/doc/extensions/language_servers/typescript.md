# TypeScript: code intelligence configuration

To enable TypeScript code intelligence, see the [installation documentation](install/index.md).

Sourcegraph's TypeScript code intelligence uses your existing [tsconfig.json](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) to analyze your TypeScript code. Multiple projects (and tsconfig.json files) in a single repository are supported.

Sourcegraph's TypeScript support is a superset of its JavaScript support. See [JavaScript language support documentation](javascript.md) for information about topics that are common to both TypeScript and JavaScript, such as:

- [Private package dependencies](javascript.md#private-package-dependencies)
