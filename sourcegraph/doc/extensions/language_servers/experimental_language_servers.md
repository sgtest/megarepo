# Experimental language servers

In Sourcegraph 3.0-preview, some experimental language support was temporarily removed. It will be restored for Sourcegraph 3.0 (non-preview). See ["Getting started" with code intelligence](../index.md#getting-started) to find and add the available Sourcegraph extensions that provide language support.

See also ["Experimental language servers" for older versions (Sourcegraph 2.x)](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/@v2.12.3/extensions/language_servers/experimental_language_servers).
