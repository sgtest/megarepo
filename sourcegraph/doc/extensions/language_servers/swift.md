# Swift: code intelligence configuration

Documentation for Swift support on Sourcegraph was moved to the [Swift Sourcegraph extension documentation](https://sourcegraph.com/extensions/sourcegraph/swift).

See [Swift documentation for older versions (Sourcegraph 2.x)](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/@v2.12.3/extensions/language_servers/swift).
