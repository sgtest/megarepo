# Sourcegraph extension authoring

A [Sourcegraph extension](../index.md) is a single JavaScript file that runs in users' web browsers in a Web Worker and has an exported `activate` function. The JavaScript file is usually produced by compiling and bundling one or more TypeScript source files.

The [extension API](https://unpkg.com/sourcegraph/dist/docs/index.html) (generated from [`sourcegraph.d.ts`](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/packages/sourcegraph-extension-api/src/sourcegraph.d.ts)) is available to extensions by importing the `sourcegraph` module (`import * as sourcegraph from 'sourcegraph'` or `require('sourcegraph')`).

Writing a Sourcegraph extension is very similar to writing an editor extension for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/overview). See the [Codecov extension's main `extension.ts` file](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-codecov/-/blob/src/extension.ts) for an example.
