**Descriptions:**

- <span class="badge badge-warning">warning</span> frontend: 20s+ 99th percentile successful search request duration over 5m

**Possible solutions:**

- **Get details on the exact queries that are slow** by configuring `"observability.logSlowSearches": 20,` in the site configuration and looking for `frontend` warning logs prefixed with `slow search request` for additional details.
- **Check that most repositories are indexed** by visiting https://sourcegraph.example.com/site-admin/repositories?filter=needs-index (it should show few or no results.)
- **Kubernetes:** Check CPU usage of zoekt-webserver in the indexed-search pod, consider increasing CPU limits in the `indexed-search.Deployment.yaml` if regularly hitting max CPU utilization.
- **Docker Compose:** Check CPU usage on the Zoekt Web Server dashboard, consider increasing `cpus:` of the zoekt-webserver container in `docker-compose.yml` if regularly hitting max CPU utilization.
- **Silence this alert:** If you are aware of this alert and want to silence notifications for it, add the following to your site configuration and set a reminder to re-evaluate the alert:

- <span class="badge badge-warning">warning</span> symbols: 2%+ frontend-internal API error responses every 5m by route for 5m0s

**Possible solutions:**

- **Single-container deployments:** Check `docker logs $CONTAINER_ID` for logs starting with `repo-updater` that indicate requests to the frontend service are failing.
- **Kubernetes:**
	- Confirm that `kubectl get pods` shows the `frontend` pods are healthy.
	- Check `kubectl logs symbols` for logs indicate request failures to `frontend` or `frontend-internal`.
- **Docker Compose:**
	- Confirm that `docker ps` shows the `frontend-internal` container is healthy.
	- Check `docker logs symbols` for logs indicating request failures to `frontend` or `frontend-internal`.

**Descriptions:**

- <span class="badge badge-warning">warning</span> precise-code-intel-indexer: 99%+ container cpu usage total (1m average) across all cores by instance

**Possible solutions:**

- **Kubernetes:** Consider increasing CPU limits in the the relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
- **Docker Compose:** Consider increasing `cpus:` of the precise-code-intel-worker container in `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Silence this alert:** If you are aware of this alert and want to silence notifications for it, add the following to your site configuration and set a reminder to re-evaluate the alert:

## precise-code-intel-indexer: container_restarts

<p class="subtitle">container restarts (code-intel)</p>

**Descriptions:**

- <span class="badge badge-warning">warning</span> precise-code-intel-indexer: 1+ container restarts
- <span class="badge badge-critical">critical</span> precise-code-intel-indexer: 1+ container restarts for 10m0s

**Possible solutions:**

- **Kubernetes:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `kubectl describe pod precise-code-intel-worker` (look for `OOMKilled: true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit in the relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `kubectl logs -p precise-code-intel-worker`.
- **Docker Compose:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `docker inspect -f '{{json .State}}' precise-code-intel-worker` (look for `"OOMKilled":true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit of the precise-code-intel-worker container in `docker-compose.yml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `docker logs precise-code-intel-worker` (note this will include logs from the previous and currently running container).
