- **Kubernetes:** Consider increasing memory limit in relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
- **Docker Compose:** Consider increasing `memory:` of zoekt-webserver container in `docker-compose.yml`.

# zoekt-webserver: container_cpu_usage

**Descriptions:**

- _zoekt-webserver: 99%+ container cpu usage total (1m average) across all cores by instance (not available on server)_

**Possible solutions:**

- **Kubernetes:** Consider increasing CPU limits in the the relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
- **Docker Compose:** Consider increasing `cpus:` of the zoekt-webserver container in `docker-compose.yml`.

# zoekt-webserver: provisioning_container_cpu_usage_1d

**Descriptions:**

- _zoekt-webserver: 80%+ or less than 30% container cpu usage total (1d average) across all cores by instance (not available on server)_

**Possible solutions:**

- **Kubernetes:** Consider decreasing CPU limits in the the relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
- **Docker Compose:** Consider descreasing `cpus:` of the zoekt-webserver container in `docker-compose.yml`.

**Possible solutions:**

- **Kubernetes:** Consider decreasing memory limit in relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
- **Docker Compose:** Consider decreasing `memory:` of zoekt-webserver container in `docker-compose.yml`.

# zoekt-webserver: provisioning_container_cpu_usage_5m

**Descriptions:**

- _zoekt-webserver: 90%+ container cpu usage total (5m average) across all cores by instance (not available on server)_

**Possible solutions:**

- **Kubernetes:** Consider increasing CPU limits in the the relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
- **Docker Compose:** Consider increasing `cpus:` of the zoekt-webserver container in `docker-compose.yml`.
