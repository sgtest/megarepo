## frontend: 99th_percentile_search_request_duration

<p class="subtitle">99th percentile successful search request duration over 5m</p>

**Descriptions**

- <span class="badge badge-warning">warning</span> frontend: 20s+ 99th percentile successful search request duration over 5m

**Possible solutions**

- **Get details on the exact queries that are slow** by configuring `"observability.logSlowSearches": 20,` in the site configuration and looking for `frontend` warning logs prefixed with `slow search request` for additional details.
- **Check that most repositories are indexed** by visiting https://sourcegraph.example.com/site-admin/repositories?filter=needs-index (it should show few or no results.)
- **Kubernetes:** Check CPU usage of zoekt-webserver in the indexed-search pod, consider increasing CPU limits in the `indexed-search.Deployment.yaml` if regularly hitting max CPU utilization.
- **Docker Compose:** Check CPU usage on the Zoekt Web Server dashboard, consider increasing `cpus:` of the zoekt-webserver container in `docker-compose.yml` if regularly hitting max CPU utilization.
- **Silence this alert:** If you are aware of this alert and want to silence notifications for it, add the following to your site configuration and set a reminder to re-evaluate the alert:

```json
"observability.silenceAlerts": [
  "warning_frontend_99th_percentile_search_request_duration"

**Descriptions**

- <span class="badge badge-warning">warning</span> executor-queue: 90%+ container cpu usage total (5m maximum) across all cores by instance for 30m0s

**Possible solutions**

- **Kubernetes:** Consider increasing CPU limits in the the relevant `Deployment.yaml`.
- **Docker Compose:** Consider increasing `cpus:` of the executor-queue container in `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Silence this alert:** If you are aware of this alert and want to silence notifications for it, add the following to your site configuration and set a reminder to re-evaluate the alert:

```json
