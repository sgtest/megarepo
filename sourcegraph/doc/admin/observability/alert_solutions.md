- _frontend: 20s+ 99th percentile successful search request duration over 5m_

**Possible solutions:**

- **Get details on the exact queries that are slow** by configuring `"observability.logSlowSearches": 20,` in the site configuration and looking for `frontend` warning logs prefixed with `slow search request` for additional details.
- **Check that most repositories are indexed** by visiting https://sourcegraph.example.com/site-admin/repositories?filter=needs-index (it should show few or no results.)
- **Kubernetes:** Check CPU usage of zoekt-webserver in the indexed-search pod, consider increasing CPU limits in the `indexed-search.Deployment.yaml` if regularly hitting max CPU utilization.
- **Docker Compose:** Check CPU usage on the Zoekt Web Server dashboard, consider increasing `cpus:` of the zoekt-webserver container in `docker-compose.yml` if regularly hitting max CPU utilization.

- **Docker Compose:**
	- Determine if the pod was OOM killed using `docker inspect -f '{{json .State}}' zoekt-indexserver` (look for `"OOMKilled":true`) and, if so, consider increasing the memory limit of the zoekt-indexserver container in `docker-compose.yml`.
	- Check the logs before the container restarted to see if there are `panic:` messages or similar using `docker logs zoekt-indexserver` (note this will include logs from the previous and currently running container).

	- **Docker Compose:** Consider increasing `cpus:` of the executor-queue container in `docker-compose.yml`.
- If usage is low, consider decreasing the above values.
