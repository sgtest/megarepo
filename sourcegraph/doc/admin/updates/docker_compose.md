# Updating a Docker Compose Sourcegraph instance

This document describes the exact changes needed to update a [Docker Compose Sourcegraph instance](../install/docker-compose.md).
Each section comprehensively describes the steps needed to upgrade, and any manual migration steps you must perform.

A new version of Sourcegraph is released every month (with patch releases in between, released as needed). Check the [Sourcegraph blog](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog) or the site admin updates page to learn about updates. We actively maintain the two most recent monthly releases of Sourcegraph.

Upgrades should happen across consecutive minor versions of Sourcegraph. For example, if you are running Sourcegraph 3.1 and want to upgrade to 3.3, you should upgrade to 3.2 and then 3.3.

**Always refer to this page before upgrading Sourcegraph,** as it comprehensively describes the steps needed to upgrade, and any manual migration steps you must perform.

## 3.20 -> 3.21

Please upgrade to the [`v3.21.0` tag of deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.21.0/docker-compose) by following the [standard upgrade procedure](#standard-upgrade-procedure).

This release introduces a second database instance, `codeintel-db`. If you have configured Sourcegraph with an external database, then update the `CODEINTEL_PG*` environment variables to point to a new external database  as described in the [external database documentation](../external_database.md). Again, these must not point to the same database or the Sourcegraph instance will refuse to start.

### If you wish to keep existing LSIF data

> Warning: **Do not upgrade out of the 3.21.x release branch** until you have seen the log message indicating the completion of the LSIF data migration, or verified that the `/lsif-storage/dbs` directory on the precise-code-intel-bundle-manager volume is empty. Otherwise, you risk data loss for precise code intelligence.

If you had LSIF data uploaded prior to upgrading to 3.21.0, there is a background migration that moves all existing LSIF data into the `codeintel-db` upon upgrade. Once this process completes, the `/lsif-storage/dbs` directory on the precise-code-intel-bundle-manager volume should be empty, and the bundle manager should print the following log message:

> Migration to Postgres has completed. All existing LSIF bundles have moved to the path /lsif-storage/db-backups and can be removed from the filesystem to reclaim space.

**Wait for the above message to be printed in `docker logs precise-code-intel-bundle-manager` before upgrading to the next Sourcegraph version**, then if everything is working you can free up disk space by deleting the backup bundle files using this command:

```sh
docker exec -it precise-code-intel-bundle-manager sh -c 'rm -rf /lsif-storage/db-backups'
```

### (Optional) Keeping LSIF data

If your users have uploaded LSIF precise code intelligence data, you may keep it by running the following command after you have ran `docker-compose up` with the new v3.15.1 version:

```
docker run --rm -it -v /var/lib/docker:/docker alpine:latest sh -c 'cp -R /docker/volumes/docker-compose_lsif-server/_data/* /docker/volumes/docker-compose_precise-code-intel-bundle-manager/_data/'
```

Followed by:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v /var/lib/docker:/docker alpine:latest sh -c 'chown -R 100:101 /docker/volumes/docker-compose_precise-code-intel-bundle-manager'
docker restart precise-code-intel-bundle-manager
```

## v3.14.2 -> v3.14.4

No manual migration is required. 

Please upgrade to the [`v3.14.4` tag of deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.14.4/docker-compose) by following the [standard upgrade procedure](#standard-upgrade-procedure).

## v3.14.0 -> v3.14.2

No manual migration is required. 

Please upgrade to the [`v3.14.2` tag of deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.14.2/docker-compose) by following the [standard upgrade procedure](#standard-upgrade-procedure).

## v3.13 -> 3.14

No manual migration is required.

Please be sure to upgrade to the [`v3.14.0-1` tag of deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.14.0-1/docker-compose) by following the [standard upgrade procedure](#standard-upgrade-procedure).

If you have upgrade to `v3.14.0` already (not the `v3.14.0-1` version) and are experiencing restarts of lsif-server, please run the following on the host machine to correct it:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v /var/lib/docker:/docker alpine:latest sh -c 'chown -R 100:101 /docker/volumes/docker-compose_lsif-server'
docker restart lsif-server
```

## v3.12 -> v3.13

A manual migration is required. Please follow the [standard upgrade procedure](#standard-upgrade-procedure) to take down the current deployment, perform the manual migration, and then upgrade using the [`v3.13.2` tag of deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/tree/v3.13.2/docker-compose).

### Manual migration step: adjust file permissions

Please adjust the redis-store and redis-cache volume permissions by running the following on the host machine:

```
docker run --rm -it -v /var/lib/docker:/docker alpine:latest sh -c 'chown -R 999:1000 /docker/volumes/docker-compose_redis-store /docker/volumes/docker-compose_redis-cache'
```

### Standard upgrade procedure

In your fork of [the deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker) repository, merge the new version into the `release` branch if you maintain any changes (see: [storing customizations in a fork](../install/docker-compose.md#optional-recommended-store-customizations-in-a-fork)):

```sh
cd docker-compose/
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream $NEW_VERSION
# Address any merge conflicts you may have.
```

Then on your server:

```sh
cd deploy-sourcegraph-docker/docker-compose/
docker-compose down
git pull
docker-compose up -d
```
