[Executors](executors.md) provide a sandbox that can run resource-intensive or untrusted tasks on behalf of the Sourcegraph instance, such as:

- [automatically indexing a repository for precise code intelligence](../code_intelligence/explanations/auto_indexing.md)
- [running batch changes](../batch_changes/explanations/server_side.md)

## Requirements

[Our sandboxing model](executors.md#how-it-works) requires the executor binary to be run on machines capable of running Linux KVM extensions. This requires bare-metal machines or machines capable of nested virtualization, which is made available by most popular Cloud providers.

## Installation

Executors operate outside of your Sourcegraph instance and must be run separately from your Sourcegraph server deployment method.

Since they must still be able to reach the Sourcegraph instance in order to dequeue and perform work, requests between the Sourcegraph instance and the executors are authenticated via a shared secret.

That means, in order to deploy executors that can talk to the Sourcegraph instance, you need to do the following:

1. [Configure a shared secret in the Sourcegraph instance](#configure-sourcegraph)
1. [Run executors](#run-executors)
  - [Using Terraform](#terraform)
  - [Using binaries](#binaries)
1. [Confirm executors can reach Sourcegraph instance](#confirm-executors-are-working)
1. Optional: [Configuring auto scaling](#configuring-auto-scaling)
1. Optional: [Configuring observability](#configuring-observability)

### Configure Sourcegraph

Before starting any executors, generate an arbitrary secret string (with at least 20 characters) and [set it as the `executors.accessToken` key in your Sourcegraph instance's site-config](config/site_config.md#view-and-edit-site-configuration).

Once the access token is set, executors can use that access token to talk to the Sourcegraph instance.

### Run executors

There are two ways to install and run executors:

1. [Using our Terraform modules to provision machines on Google Cloud or AWS that run executors](#terraform)
2. [Downloading and running executor binaries yourself](#binaries)

#### Terraform

We supply [Terraform modules](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/module-use?in=terraform/modules) to provision machines running executors on common cloud providers ([Google Cloud](https://github.com/sourcegraph/terraform-google-executors) or [AWS](https://github.com/sourcegraph/terraform-aws-executors)).

A Terraform definition of executor compute resources will look similar to the following basic, minimal usage. Here, we configure the use of a Terraform module defined in the public registry - no explicit installation or clone step is required to use the modules provided by Sourcegraph.

```hcl
module "executors" {
  source  = "sourcegraph/executors/<cloud>"
  version = "<version>"

  executor_sourcegraph_external_url            = "<sourcegraph_external_url>"
  executor_sourcegraph_executor_proxy_password = "<shared_secret_configured_in_sourcegraph_instance>"
  executor_queue_name                          = "codeintel" # Type of work (e.g., codeintel, batches)
  executor_instance_tag                        = "codeintel"
  executor_metrics_environment_label           = "prod"
  docker_mirror_static_ip                      = "10.0.1.4"
}
```

Two variables must be supplied to the module in order for it to contact your Sourcegraph instance:

- `sourcegraph_external_url` ([Google](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub.com/sourcegraph/terraform-google-executors%24+variable+%22sourcegraph_external_url%22&patternType=literal); [AWS](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub.com/sourcegraph/terraform-aws-executors%24+variable+%22sourcegraph_external_url%22&patternType=literal)): The **public** URL of your Sourcegraph instance. This corresponds to the `externalURL` value in your Sourcegraph instance's site-config and must be resolvable from the provisioned executor compute resources.
- `sourcegraph_executor_proxy_password` ([Google](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub.com/sourcegraph/terraform-google-executors%24+variable+%22sourcegraph_executor_proxy_password%22&patternType=literal); [AWS](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub.com/sourcegraph/terraform-aws-executors%24+variable+%22sourcegraph_executor_proxy_password%22&patternType=literal)): The access token chosen and configured above.

Additional values may need to be supplied for a specific cloud provider. Refer to the relevant Terraform module documentation for specifics.

To deploy executor compute resources defined in the Terraform file above, simply run `terraform apply`.

See the [Examples](#examples) for more information on how to configure and deploy single or multiple executors.

#### Binaries

You can also download and run the executor binaries yourself, without using Terraform.

The following dependencies need to be available on the machine on which you want to run the `executor` binary:

* Docker
* git >= v2.18
* [Ignite](https://ignite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/) v0.10.0
* [CNI Plugins](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins) v0.9.1

You can also take a look at [what goes into our executor machine images, used by our Terraform modules,](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/main/enterprise/cmd/executor/image/build.sh) to see how we run executor binaries.

Once dependencies are met, you can download and run executor binaries:

**Step 1:** Confirm that virtualization is enabled

The following command checks whether virtualization is enabled on the machine, which is required for [our sandboxing model](executors.md#how-it-works).

If it prints something other than 0, virtualization is enabled.

```bash
grep -cw vmx /proc/cpuinfo
```

**Step 2:** Download latest binary

Below are the download links for the *insiders* release (`latest`) of executors:

* [`info.txt`](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-artifacts/executor/latest/info.txt)
* [`linux-amd64/executor`](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-artifacts/executor/latest/linux-amd64/executor)
* [`linux-amd64/executor_SHA256SUM`](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-artifacts/executor/latest/linux-amd64/executor_SHA256SUM)

Download and setup `executor` binary:

```bash
curl -sfLo executor https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-artifacts/executor/latest/linux-amd64/executor
chmod +x executor
mv executor /usr/local/bin
```

**Step 3:** Generate Ignite base image

This creates the base image that Ignite will use when creating new [Firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/) microVMs for each job.

```bash
# Change this to use the version of src-cli that's compatible with your Sourcegraph instance.
# See this for details: https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli#version-compatible-with-your-sourcegraph-instance
export SRC_CLI_VERSION="3.34.1"
export EXECUTOR_FIRECRACKER_IMAGE="sourcegraph/ignite-ubuntu:insiders"

# Download Dockerfile and build Docker image
mkdir -p /tmp/ignite-ubuntu
curl -sfLo /tmp/ignite-ubuntu/Dockerfile https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/main/enterprise/cmd/executor/image/ignite-ubuntu/Dockerfile
docker build -t "${EXECUTOR_FIRECRACKER_IMAGE}" --build-arg SRC_CLI_VERSION="${SRC_CLI_VERSION}" /tmp/ignite-ubuntu

# Import Docker image into Ignite
ignite image import --runtime docker "${EXECUTOR_FIRECRACKER_IMAGE}"

# Clean up
docker image rm "${EXECUTOR_FIRECRACKER_IMAGE}"
```

**Step 4:** _Optional_: Pre-heat Ignite by importing kernel image

This step imports the kernel image to avoid the executor having to import it when executing the first job.

```bash
# Change this to match the version of Ignite you're using.
export IGNITE_VERSION=v0.10.0
export KERNEL_IMAGE="weaveworks/ignite-kernel:5.10.51"

ignite kernel import --runtime docker "${KERNEL_IMAGE}"
docker pull "weaveworks/ignite:${IGNITE_VERSION}"
```

**Step 5:** Setup required environment variables

| Env var                       | Example value | Description |
| ------------------------------| ------------- | ----------- |
| `EXECUTOR_FRONTEND_URL`       | `http://sourcegraph.example.com` | The external URL of the Sourcegraph instance. |
| `EXECUTOR_FRONTEND_PASSWORD`  | `our-shared-secret` | The shared secret configured in the Sourcegraph instannce under `executors.accessToken` |
| `EXECUTOR_QUEUE_NAME`         | `batches`     | The name of the queue to pull jobs from to. Possible values: `batches` and `codeintel` |

```bash
# Example:
export EXECUTOR_QUEUE_NAME=batches
export EXECUTOR_FRONTEND_URL=http://sourcegraph.example.com
export EXECUTOR_FRONTEND_PASSWORD=hunter2hunter2hunter2
```

**Step 6:** Start executor

```bash
/usr/local/bin/executor
```

### Confirm executors are working

If executor instances boot correctly and can authenticate with the Sourcegraph frontend, they will show up in the _Executors_ page under _Site Admin_ > _Maintenance_.

![Executor list in UI](https://storage.googleapis.com/sourcegraph-assets/docs/images/code-intelligence/sg-3.34/executor-ui-test.png)

### Examples

The following are complete examples of provisioning a _single_ executor type using each of the provided Terraform modules. In these examples, executors pull from the queue `codeintel`, which controls [auto-indexing](../code_intelligence/explanations/auto_indexing.md).

- [AWS example](https://github.com/sourcegraph/terraform-aws-executors/tree/master/examples/single-executor)
- [Google example](https://github.com/sourcegraph/terraform-google-executors/tree/master/examples/single-executor)

The following are complete examples of provisioning _multiple_ executor types using the provided Terraform submodules. In these examples, two pools of executors pull from the `codeintel` and `batches` queues, which control [auto-indexing](../code_intelligence/explanations/auto_indexing.md) and  [running batch changes server-side](../batch_changes/explanations/server_side.md), respectively.

- [AWS example](https://github.com/sourcegraph/terraform-aws-executors/tree/master/examples/multiple-executors)
- [Google example](https://github.com/sourcegraph/terraform-google-executors/tree/master/examples/multiple-executors)

#### Example installation

Let's walk through setting up a single executor VM on GCP and indexing a repository.

1. Install Terraform `0.13.7` (must match the version listed in [`.tool-versions`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/terraform-google-executors/blob/master/.tool-versions)):

```
brew install tfenv
tfenv install 0.13.7
tfenv use 0.13.7
```

2. Install [`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
3. Run `gcloud auth application-default login`
4. Open your Sourcegraph instance in your browser, click your profile in the top right, click **Site admin**, expand **Configuration**, click **Site configuration**, and set:
  - `"externalURL": "<URL>"` to a URL that is accessible from the GCP VM that will be created later (e.g. a public URL such as `https://sourcegraph.example.com`)
  - `"executors.accessToken": "<new long secret>"` to a new long secret (e.g. `cat /dev/random | base64 | head -c 20`)
  - `"codeIntelAutoIndexing.enabled": true`
5. Download the [example files](https://github.com/sourcegraph/terraform-google-executors/blob/master/examples/single-executor) and change these:
  - `project`: your GCP project name and change `region` and `zone` if needed
  - `executor_sourcegraph_external_url`: this must match `externalURL` you set in your site config
  - `executor_sourcegraph_executor_proxy_password`: this must match `executors.accessToken` you set in your site config
6. Run `terraform init` to download the Sourcegraph executor modules
7. Run `terraform apply` and enter "yes" to create the executor VM
8. Go back to the site admin page, expand **Maintenance**, click **Executors**, and check to see if your executor shows up in the list with a green dot 🟢. If it's not there:
  - Make sure `terraform apply` exited with code 0 and did not print any errors
  - Make sure a GCP VM was created:

```
$ gcloud compute instances list
NAME                                          ZONE           MACHINE_TYPE   PREEMPTIBLE  INTERNAL_IP  EXTERNAL_IP    STATUS
sourcegraph-executor-h0rv                     us-central1-c  n1-standard-4               10.0.1.16    ...            RUNNING
sourcegraph-executors-docker-registry-mirror  us-central1-c  n1-standard-2               10.0.1.2     ...            RUNNING
```

  - Make sure the `executor` service is running:

```
you@sourcegraph-executor-h0rv:~$ systemctl status executor
🟢 executor.service - User code executor
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/executor.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Thu 2021-11-18 02:28:48 UTC; 19s ago
```

  - Make sure there are no errors in the `executor` service logs:

```
you@sourcegraph-executor-h0rv:~$ journalctl -u executor | less
Nov 18 02:31:01 sourcegraph-executor-h0rv executor[2465]: t=2021-11-18T02:31:01+0000 lvl=dbug msg="TRACE internal" host=... path=/.executors/queue/codeintel/dequeue code=204 duration=92.131237ms
Nov 18 02:31:01 sourcegraph-executor-h0rv executor[2465]: t=2021-11-18T02:31:01+0000 lvl=dbug msg="TRACE internal" host=... path=/.executors/queue/codeintel/canceled code=200 duration=90.630467ms
Nov 18 02:31:02 sourcegraph-executor-h0rv executor[2465]: t=2021-11-18T02:31:02+0000 lvl=dbug msg="TRACE internal" host=... path=/.executors/queue/codeintel/dequeue code=204 duration=91.269106ms
Nov 18 02:31:02 sourcegraph-executor-h0rv executor[2465]: t=2021-11-18T02:31:02+0000 lvl=dbug msg="TRACE internal" host=... path=/.executors/queue/codeintel/canceled code=200 duration=161.469685ms
```

  - Make sure the `EXECUTOR_FRONTEND_URL` and `EXECUTOR_FRONTEND_PASSWORD` in `/etc/systemd/system/executor.env` are correct
  - Make sure the VM can hit your `externalURL`:

```
you@sourcegraph-executor-h0rv:~$ curl <your externalURL here>
<a href="/sign-in?returnTo=%2F">Found</a>
```

9. Go back to the site admin page, expand **Code intelligence**, click **Configuration**, click **Create new policy**, and fill in:
  - Name: `LSIF`
  - Click **add a repository pattern**
  - Repository pattern #1: set this to an existing repository on your Sourcegraph instance (e.g. `github.com/gorilla/mux`)
  - Type: `HEAD`
  - Auto-indexing: Enabled
10. Go to that repository's page, click **Code Intelligence**, click **Auto-indexing**, and check to see if an indexing job has appeared. If nothing is there:
  - Try clicking **Enqueue**
  - Try setting a higher update frequency: `PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_AUTO_INDEXING_TASK_INTERVAL=10s`
  - Try setting a lower delay: `PRECISE_CODE_INTEL_AUTO_INDEXING_REPOSITORY_PROCESS_DELAY=10s`
11. Once you have a completed indexing job, click **Uploads** and check to see that the LSIF dump has been uploaded.
12. Once the dump has been uploaded, you should see the **`PRECISE`** badge in the hover popover! 🎉
13. Optionally, add `.terraform`, `terraform.tfstate`, and `terraform.tfstate.backup` to your `.gitignore`.

## Configuring auto scaling

> NOTE: Auto scaling is currently not supported when [downloading and running executor binaries yourself](#binaries)

Auto scaling of executor instances can help to increase concurrency of jobs, without paying for unused resources. With auto scaling, you can scale down to 0 instances when no workload exist and scale up as far as you like and your cloud provider can support. Auto scaling needs to be configured separately.

Auto scaling makes use of the auto-scaling capabilities of the respective cloud provider (AutoScalingGroups on AWS and Instance Groups on GCP). Sourcegraph's `worker` service publishes a scaling metric (that is, the number of jobs in queue) to the cloud providers. Then, based on that reported value, the auto scalers add and remove compute resources to match the required amount of compute. The autoscaler will attempt to hold 1 instance running per each [`jobs_per_instance_scaling`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub.com/sourcegraph/terraform-.*-executors%24+variable+%22jobs_per_instance_scaling%22&patternType=literal) items in queue.

For example, if `jobs_per_instance_scaling` is set to `20` and the queue size is currently `400`, then `20` instances would be determined as required to handle the load. You might want to tweak this number based on the [machine type](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub.com/sourcegraph/terraform-.*-executors%24+variable+%22machine_type%22+-f:docker-mirror&patternType=literal), [concurrency per machine](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub.com/sourcegraph/terraform-.*-executors%24+variable+%22maximum_num_jobs%22&patternType=literal) and desired processing speed.

With the Terraform variables [`min_replicas`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub.com/sourcegraph/terraform-.*-executors%24+variable+%22min_replicas%22&patternType=literal) and [`max_replicas`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub.com/sourcegraph/terraform-.*-executors%24+variable+%22max_replicas%22&patternType=literal) in the Terraform modules linked to above, you can configure the minimum and maximum number of compute machines to be run at a given time.

For auto scaling to work, two things must be true:

1. `min_replicas` must be `>= 0` and `max_replicas` must be `> min_replicas`.
2. The Sourcegraph instance (its `worker` service, specifically) needs to publish scaling metrics to the used cloud provider.

For the latter to work, the Sourcegraph instance needs to be configured with the correct credentials that allow it to access the cloud provider.

The `credentials` submodule in both our [AWS](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/terraform-aws-executors/-/tree/modules/credentials) and [GCP](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/terraform-google-executors/-/tree/modules/credentials) executor modules exists for that purpose. When used, the `credentials` module sets up the credentials on the cloud provider and returns them in the Terraform outputs.

Here's an example of how one would use the `credentials` submodule:

```terraform
module "my-credentials" {
  source  = "sourcegraph/executors/<cloud>//modules/credentials"

  # Find the latest version here:
  # - https://github.com/sourcegraph/terraform-google-executors/tags
  # - https://github.com/sourcegraph/terraform-aws-executors/tags
  version = "<version>"

  region          = <region>
  resource_prefix = ""
}

# For Google:
output "metric_writer_credentials_file" {
  value = module.my-credentials.metric_writer_credentials_file
}

# For AWS:
output "metric_writer_access_key_id" {
  value = module.my-credentials.metric_writer_access_key_id
}

output "metric_writer_secret_key" {
  value = module.my-credentials.metric_writer_secret_key
}
```

After a `terraform apply`, a `terraform output` should yield something like this:

```
# For AWS:
metric_writer_access_key_id = <THE_ACCESS_KEY_TO_CONFIGURE>
metric_writer_secret_key    = <THE_SECRET_KEY_TO_CONFIGURE>

# For Google:
metric_writer_credentials_file = <THE_CREDENTIALS_FILE_CONTENT_BASE64_ENCODED>
```

These outputs can then be used to configure the Sourcegraph instance, which is explained in the following sections for the different cloud providers.

### Google

The GCE auto-scaling groups configured by the Sourcegraph Terraform module respond to changes in metric values written to Cloud Monitoring. The target Sourcegraph instance is expected to continuously write these values.

To write the scaling metric to Cloud Monitoring, the `worker` service must have defined the following environment variables:

- `EXECUTOR_METRIC_ENVIRONMENT_LABEL`: Must use the value that was set as [`metrics_environment_label`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub.com/sourcegraph/terraform-google-executors%24+variable+%22metrics_environment_label%22&patternType=literal) when provisioning `executors`
- `EXECUTOR_METRIC_GCP_PROJECT_ID`: The GCP project ID
- Option 1: `EXECUTOR_METRIC_GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_FILE_CONTENT`: The base64-decoded output of the `metric_writer_credentials_file` from above.
- Option 2: `EXECUTOR_METRIC_GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_FILE`: Path to a file containing the base64-decoded `metric_writer_credentials_file` output from above.

### AWS

The EC2 auto-scaling groups configured by the Sourcegraph Terraform module respond to changes in metric values written to CloudWatch. The target Sourcegraph instance is expected to continuously write these values.

To write the scaling metric to CloudWatch, the `worker` service must have defined the following environment variables:

- `EXECUTOR_METRIC_ENVIRONMENT_LABEL`: Must use the same value as [`metrics_environment_label`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub.com/sourcegraph/terraform-aws-executors%24+variable+%22metrics_environment_label%22&patternType=literal)
- `EXECUTOR_METRIC_AWS_NAMESPACE`: Must be set to `sourcegraph-executor`
- `EXECUTOR_METRIC_AWS_REGION`
- `EXECUTOR_METRIC_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `EXECUTOR_METRIC_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

### Testing auto scaling

Once these are set, and the worker service has been restarted, you should be able to find the scaling metrics in your cloud providers dashboards.

To test if the metric is correctly reported into the Cloud provider:

- On Google Cloud, this can be found in the **Metrics explorer**. Select **Resource type: Global** and then **Metric: `custom/executors/queue/size`**. You should see values reported here. 0 is also an indicator that it works correct.

- On AWS, this can be found in the CloudWatch metrics section. Under **All metrics**, select the namespace `sourcegraph-executor` and then the metric `environment, queueName`. Make sure there are entries returned.

Next, you can test whether the number of executors rises and shrinks as load spikes occur. Keep in mind that auto-scaling is not a real-time operation on most cloud providers and usually takes a short moment and can have some delays between the metric going down and the desired machine count adjusting.

## Configuring observability

> NOTE: Observability features are currently not supported when [downloading and running executor binaries yourself](#binaries)

Sourcegraph [ships with dashboards](observability/metrics.md) that can display executor metrics. We highly encourage setting this up to help make informed decisions on scaling and to make debugging easier.

In order to do that, the Prometheus instance bundled with your Sourcegraph deployment must be able to scrape the executor metrics endpoint.

That requires two things:

1. Provide Prometheus with service account credentials that allow it to get a list of active compute instances from the cloud provider.
2. Add additional scrape jobs to Prometheus.

To add service account credentials, you can use the `credentials` submodule in both our [AWS](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/terraform-aws-executors/-/tree/modules/credentials) and [GCP](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/terraform-google-executors/-/tree/modules/credentials) executor modules.

```terraform
module "credentials" {
  source  = "sourcegraph/executors/<cloud>//modules/credentials"
  version = "<version>"

  region          = <region>
  resource_prefix = ""
}

# For Google:
output "instance_scraper_credentials_file" {
  value = module.my-credentials.instance_scraper_credentials_file
}

# For AWS:
output "instance_scraper_access_key_id" {
  value = module.my-credentials.instance_scraper_access_key_id
}

output "instance_scraper_access_secret_key" {
  value = module.my-credentials.instance_scraper_access_secret_key
}
```

Just as with [auto scaling](#configuring-auto-scaling), you use the `credentials` submodule to get properly configured credentials in the Terraform outputs. When applied, this will yield something like this:

```
# For AWS:
instance_scraper_access_key_id     = <THE_ACCESS_KEY_TO_CONFIGURE>
instance_scraper_access_secret_key = <THE_SECRET_KEY_TO_CONFIGURE>

# For Google:
instance_scraper_credentials_file = <THE_CREDENTIALS_FILE_CONTENT>
```

Now we can use these credentials for the different cloud providers.

### Google

Credentials need to be added to the Prometheus container of your Sourcegraph deployment and a new scrape job needs to be added.

In a Kubernetes deployment, credentials can be added by mounting the credentials file obtained from the `credentials` module in the last step, and pointing to it from an environment variable.

**Step 1:** Create a secret called `prometheus-secrets` containing the credentials file content:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: Opaque
metadata:
  name: prometheus-secrets
data:
  # The Terraform output for `instance_scraper_credentials_file`
  GCP_ACCOUNT_JSON: <THE_CREDENTIALS_FILE_CONTENT>
```

**Step 2:** Modify the Prometheus deployment manifest:

```yaml
containers:
- name: prometheus
  # [...]
  env:
  - name: GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
    value: /credentials/google_application_credentials.json
  volumeMounts:
  - mountPath: /credentials/google_application_credentials.json
    name: credentials
    subPath: google_application_credentials.json
    readOnly: true
volumes:
- name: credentials
  secret:
    secretName: prometheus-secrets
    items:
    - key: GCP_ACCOUNT_JSON
      path: google_application_credentials.json

```

**Step 3:** Add the following scraping job that uses [GCE service discovery configuration](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#gce_sd_config) to the Prometheus configuration. To do that, you can edit the Prometheus `ConfigMap` and modify the contents of the `prometheus.yml` file. Under [`scrape_configs:`](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph@0938b6686f0c94d80e8331e36f5ddac4659027b1/-/blob/base/prometheus/prometheus.ConfigMap.yaml?L43:5) add the following and make sure to replace `{GCP_PROJECT}`, `{GCP_ZONE}` and `{INSTANCE_TAG}`. The `{INSTANCE_TAG}` value must be the same as [`instance_tag`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub.com/sourcegraph/terraform-aws-executors%24+variable+%22instance_tag%22&patternType=literal).

```yaml
- job_name: 'sourcegraph-executors'
  metrics_path: /proxy
  params:
    module: [executor]
  gce_sd_configs: &executor_gce_config
    - project: {GCP_PROJECT} # Change this to the GCP project ID
      port: 9999
      zone: {GCP_ZONE} # Change this to the GCP zone
      filter: '(labels.executor_tag = {INSTANCE_TAG})' # Change {INSTANCE_TAG} to the `executor_instance_tag` set in the Terraform modules
  relabel_configs: &executor_relabel_config
    - source_labels: [__meta_gce_public_ip]
      target_label: __address__
      replacement: "${1}${2}:9999"
      separator: ''

**Step 4:** Restart Prometheus.

If you currently have any executors or Docker registry mirrors running, you should start seeing metrics on the _Executors_ dashboard in Grafana. Alternatively, you can check if the executors can be scraped, by [port-forwarding the Prometheus UI to your local machine and checkin in the UI](./observability/metrics.md#accessing-prometheus-directly).

### AWS

Credentials need to be added to the Prometheus container of your Sourcegraph deployment and a new scrape job needs to be added.

In a Kubernetes deployment, credentials can be added by setting the two secrets obtained from the `credentials` module in the last step as environment variables.

**Step 1:** Modify the Prometheus deployment manifest:

```yaml
containers:
- name: prometheus
  # [...]
  env:
  - name: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    # The Terraform output for `instance_scraper_access_key_id`
    value: <THE_ACCESS_KEY_TO_CONFIGURE>
  - name: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    # The Terraform output for `instance_scraper_access_secret_key`
    value: <THE_SECRET_KEY_TO_CONFIGURE>
```

**Step 2:** Add the following scraping job that uses [EC2 service discovery configuration](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#ec2_sd_config) to the Prometheus configuration. To do that, you can edit the Prometheus `ConfigMap` and modify the contents of the `prometheus.yml` file. Under [`scrape_configs:`](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph@master/-/blob/base/prometheus/prometheus.ConfigMap.yaml?L43:5) add the following and make sure to replace `{AWS_REGION}` and `{INSTANCE_TAG}`. The `{INSTANCE_TAG}` value must be the same as [`instance_tag`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub.com/sourcegraph/terraform-aws-executors%24+variable+%22instance_tag%22&patternType=literal).

```yaml
- job_name: 'sourcegraph-executors'
  metrics_path: /proxy
  params:
    module: [executor]
  ec2_sd_configs: &executor_ec2_config
    - region: {AWS_REGION} # Change this to the AWS region
      port: 9999
      filters:
        - name: tag:executor_tag
