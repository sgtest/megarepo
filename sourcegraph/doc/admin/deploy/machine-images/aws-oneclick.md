## Instance Size Chart

Determine the instance type required to support the number of users and repositories you have using this table. If you fall between two sizes, choose the larger of the two.

For example, if you have 8,000 users with 80,000 repositories, your instance size would be **L**. If you have 1,000 users with 80,000 repositories, you should go with size **M**.

|                      | **XS**      | **S**       | **M**       | **L**        | **XL**       |
|----------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Users**            | _<=_ 500    | _<=_ 1,000  | _<=_ 5,000  | _<=_ 10,000  | _<=_ 20,000  |
| **Repositories**     | _<=_ 5,000  | _<=_ 10,000 | _<=_ 50,000 | _<=_ 100,000 | _<=_ 250,000 |
| **Recommended Type** | m6a.2xlarge | m6a.4xlarge | m6a.8xlarge | m6a.12xlarge | m6a.24xlarge |
| **Minimum Type**     | m6a.2xlarge | m6a.2xlarge | m6a.4xlarge | m6a.8xlarge  | m6a.12xlarge |

## Deploy Sourcegraph

### Prerequisites

1. Create an [EC2 Key Pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-key-pairs.html)

>NOTE: The instance will launch in the default configured VPC. If your AWS user does not have a default VPC, or the `Auto-assign public IPv4 address` option is not enabled for a subnet within that VPC, please see the [Manual AMI](aws-ami.md) instructions

### Steps

1. Choose an AWS Region in the launcher below
2. Click on the `Launch Stack` button
3. Select an `SSH Keypair`
4. Select a `Sourcegraph Instance Size` according to [the sizing chart](#instance-size-chart).

 ðŸŽ‰ You can now start a Sourcegraph instance by clicking on the `Create Stack` button ðŸŽ‰

> NOTE: Once the instance has been created, Sourcegraph will be running at your serverâ€™s IP address, which allows you to navigate to your newly created Sourcegraph instance in your browser. You can also find the URL for your Sourcegraph instance in the 'Outputs' section of the Stack. Sourcegraph may take a few minutes initialize on first launch!

### Networking
