# Install Sourcegraph with Docker Compose on AWS

This guide shows you how to deploy Sourcegraph via [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to a single EC2 instance on AWS.

> NOTE: Trying to decide how to deploy Sourcegraph? See [our recommendations](../index.md) for how to choose a deployment type that suits your needs.

## Determine server and service requirements 

Use the [resource estimator](../resource_estimator.md) to determine the resource requirements for your environment. You will use this information to set up the instance and configure the docker-compose YAML file. 

## Prepare a fork 

We strongly recommend that you create and run Sourcegraph from your own fork of the reference repository. You will make changes to the default configuration, for example to the docker-compose YAML file, in your fork. The fork will also enable you to keep track of your customizations when upgrading your fork from the reference repo. Refer to the following steps for preparing a clone, which use GitHub as an example, then return to this page:

1. [Fork the reference repo](index.md#fork-the-sourcegraph-reference-repository)
2. [Clone your fork](index.md#clone-your-fork)
3. [Configure a release branch](index.md#configure-a-release-branch)
4. [Configure the YAML file](index.md#configure-the-yaml-file)
5. [Publish changes to your branch](index.md#publish-your-changes-to-the-release-branch)

## Deploy to EC2

* Click **Launch Instance** from your [EC2 dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home).
* Select the **Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type**.
* Select an appropriate instance size (use the [resource estimator](../resource_estimator.md) to find a good starting point for your deployment), then click **Next: Configure Instance Details.**
* Ensure the **Auto-assign Public IP** option is set to "Enable". This ensures your instance is accessible to the Internet.
* Place the following script in the **User Data** text box at the bottom of the **Configure Instance Details** page

> WARNING: If working from a fork of the reference repository, update the following variables in the script:
> 
> * `DEPLOY_SOURCEGRAPH_DOCKER_FORK_CLONE_URL`: Your fork's git clone URL
> * `DEPLOY_SOURCEGRAPH_DOCKER_FORK_REVISION`: The git revision containing your fork's customizations to the base Sourcegraph Docker Compose YAML. In the [example](index.md#configure-a-release-branch) the revision is the `release` branch.

```

* Select **Next: Add Storage**
* Click "Add New Volume" and add an additional volume (for storing Docker data) with the following settings:

  * **Volume Type** (left-most column): EBS
  * **IMPORTANT: Device**: `/dev/sdb`
  * **Size (GiB)**: `250` GB minimum *(As a rule of thumb, Sourcegraph needs at least as much space as all your repositories combined take up. Allocating as much disk space as you can upfront helps you avoid [resizing your volume](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/expand-root-ebs-linux/) later on.)*
  * **Volume Type**: General Purpose SSD (gp2)
  * **Delete on Termination**: Leave this setting unchecked

* Select **Next: ...** until you get to the **Configure Security Group** page. Then add the following rules:
  * Default **HTTP** rule: port range `80`, source `0.0.0.0/0, ::/0`
  * Default **HTTPS** rule: port range `443`, source `0.0.0.0/0, ::/0`<br>(NOTE: additional work will be required later on to [configure SSL in the Docker Compose deployment](../../../admin/http_https_configuration.md#sourcegraph-via-docker-compose-caddy-2))

> WARNING: While this port configuration will work, it provides open access of the ports specified. If possible, replace the IP address ranges specified with the IPs from which you actually want to allow access.

* Launch your instance, then navigate to its public IP in your browser. (This can be found by navigating to the instance page on EC2 and looking in the "Description" panel for the "IPv4 Public IP" value.) You may have to wait a minute or two for the instance to finish initializing before Sourcegraph becomes accessible. You can monitor the status by SSHing into the instance and using the diagnostic commands:

```bash
# Follow the status of the user data script you provided earlier
tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log

# (Once the user data script completes) monitor the health of the "sourcegraph-frontend" container
docker ps --filter="name=sourcegraph-frontend-0"
```

## Update your Sourcegraph version

Refer to the [Docker Compose upgrade docs](../../updates/upgrade_docker-compose.md).

## Storage and Backups

The [Sourcegraph Docker Compose definition](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/blob/master/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml) uses [Docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) to store its data. The previous script [configures Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-configuration-file) to store all Docker data on the additional EBS volume that was attached to the instance (mounted at `/mnt/docker-data` - the volumes themselves are stored under `/mnt/docker-data/volumes`) There are a few different ways to backup this data:

* (**recommended**) The most straightforward method to backup this data is to [snapshot the entire `/mnt/docker-data` EBS disk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-creating-snapshot.html) on an [automatic, scheduled basis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/snapshot-lifecycle.html).

* Using an external Postgres instance lets a service such as [AWS RDS for PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) take care of backing up all of Sourcegraph's user data for you. If the EC2 instance running Sourcegraph ever dies or is destroyed, creating a fresh instance that's connected to that external Postgres will leave Sourcegraph in the same state that it was before.
