# Configuration

You can find the default [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/blob/master/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml) file inside the deployment repository.

If you would like to make changes to the default configurations, we highly recommend you to create a new file called `docker-compose.override.yaml` in the same directory where the base file ([docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/blob/master/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml)) is located, and make your customizations inside the `docker-compose.override.yaml` file.

>WARNING: For configuration of Sourcegraph, see Sourcegraph's [configuration](../../config/index.md) docs.

## What is an override file?

Docker Compose allows you to customize configuration settings using an override file called `docker-compose.override.yaml`, which allows customizations to persist through upgrades without needing to manage merge conflicts as changes are not made directly to the base `docker-compose.yaml` file.

When you run the `docker-compose up` command, the override file will be automatically merged over the base [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/blob/master/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml) file.

The [official Docker Compose docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/) provide details about override files.

## Examples

In order to make changes to the configuration settings defined in the base file [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/blob/master/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml), create an empty `docker-compose.override.yaml` file in the same directory as the [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/blob/master/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml) file, using the same version number, and then add the customizations under the `services` field.

### Adjust resources

Note that you will only need to list the fragments that you would like to change from the base file.

```yaml
# docker-compose.override.yaml
version: '2.4'
services:
  gitserver-0:
    cpus: 8
    mem_limit: '26g'
```

### Create multiple gitserver shards

Split gitserver across multiple shards:

```yaml
# docker-compose.override.yaml
version: '2.4'
services:
# Adjust resources for gitserver-0
# And then create an anchor to share with the replica
  gitserver-0: &gitserver
    cpus: 8
    mem_limit: '26g'
# Create a new service called gitserver-1,
# which is an extension of gitserver-0
  gitserver-1:
  # Extend the original gitserver-0 to get the image values etc
    extends:
      file: docker-compose.yaml
      service: gitserver-0
    # Use the new resources values from gitserver-0 above
    <<: *gitserver
    # Since this is an extension of the original gitserver-0,
    # we will have to rename the container name to gitserver-1
    container_name: gitserver-1
    # Assign it to a new volume which we will create below in the volumes section
    volumes:
      - 'gitserver-1:/data/repos'
    # Assign a new host name so it doesn't use the gitserver-0 one
    hostname: gitserver-1
# Add the new replica to other related services as environment
  sourcegraph-frontend-0: &frontend
    cpus: 6
    mem_limit: '6g'
    environment:
      - &env_gitserver 'SRC_GIT_SERVERS=gitserver-0:3178 gitserver-1:3178'
# Use the same override values as sourcegraph-frontend-0 above
  sourcegraph-frontend-internal:
    <<: *frontend
# Add the updated environment for gitserver from frontend to worker using anchor
  worker:
    environment:
      - *env_gitserver
# Add a new volume assigned to the new gitserver replica
volumes:
  gitserver-1:
```

### Disable a service

You can "disable services" by assigning them to one or more [profiles](https://docs.docker.com/compose/profiles/), so that when running the `docker compose up` command, services assigned to profiles will not be started unless explicitly specified in the command (e.g., `docker compose --profile disabled up`).

For example, when you need to disable the internal codeintel-db in order to use an external database, you can assign `codeintel-db` to a profile called `disabled`: 

```yaml
# docker-compose.override.yaml
version: '2.4'
services:
  codeintel-db:
    profiles:
      - disabled
```

### Enable tracing

Tracing should be enabled in the `docker-compose.yaml` file by default. 

If not, you can enable it by setting the environment variable to `SAMPLING_STRATEGIES_FILE=/etc/jaeger/sampling_strategies.json` in the `jaeger` container:

```yaml
# docker-compose.override.yaml
version: '2.4'
services:
  jaeger:
    environment:
      - 'SAMPLING_STRATEGIES_FILE=/etc/jaeger/sampling_strategies.json'
```

### Git configuration

#### Git SSH configuration

Provide your `gitserver` instance with your SSH / Git configuration (e.g. `.ssh/config`, `.ssh/id_rsa`, `.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, and `.ssh/known_hosts`. You can also provide other files like `.netrc`, `.gitconfig`, etc. if needed) by mounting a directory that contains this configuration into the `gitserver` container.

For example, in the `gitserver-0` container configuration in your `docker-compose.yaml` file or `docker-compose.override.yaml`, add the volume listed in the following example, while replacing `~/path/on/host/` with the path on the host machine to the `.ssh` directory:

```yaml
# docker-compose.override.yaml
version: '2.4'
services:
  gitserver-0:
    volumes:
      - 'gitserver-0:/data/repos'
      - '~/path/on/host/.ssh:/home/sourcegraph/.ssh'
```

> WARNING: The permissions on your SSH / Git configuration must be set to be readable by the user in the `gitserver` container. For example, run `chmod -v -R 600 ~/path/to/.ssh` in the folder on the host machine.

#### Git HTTP(S) authentication

The easiest way to specify HTTP(S) authentication for repositories is to include the username and password in the clone URL itself, such as `https://user:password@example.com/my/repo`. These credentials won't be displayed to non-admin users.

Otherwise, follow the previous steps for mounting SSH configuration to mount a host directory containing the desired `.netrc` file to `/home/sourcegraph/` in the `gitserver` container.

### Expose debug port

To [generate pprof profiling data](../../pprof.md), you must configure your deployment to expose port 6060 on one of your frontend containers, for example:

```yaml
# docker-compose.override.yaml
version: '2.4'
services:
  sourcegraph-frontend-0:
    ports:
      - '0.0.0.0:6060:6060'
```

For specific ports that can be exposed, see the [debug ports section](../../pprof.md#debug-ports) of Sourcegraphs's [generate pprof profiling data](../../pprof.md) docs.

### Set environment variables

Add/modify the environment variables to all of the sourcegraph-frontend-* services and the sourcegraph-frontend-internal service in the [Docker Compose YAML file](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/blob/master/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml):

```yaml
# docker-compose.override.yaml
version: '2.4'
services:
  sourcegraph-frontend-0:
    environment:
      - (YOUR CODE)
```

See ["Environment variables in Compose"](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/) for other ways to pass these environment variables to the relevant services (including from the command line, a .env file, etc.).


### Use an external database

The Docker Compose configuration has its own internal PostgreSQL and Redis databases. 

You can alternatively configure Sourcegraph to [use external services](../../external_services/index.md).
