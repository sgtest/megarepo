# Sourcegraph with Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-[container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) Docker applications (in this case, Sourcegraph!). With Docker Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. To learn more about Docker Compose, head over to [Docker's Docker Compose docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

For Sourcegraph customers who want a simplified single-machine deployment of Sourcegraph with easy configuration and low cost of effort to maintain, Sourcegraph with Docker Compose is an ideal choice.

Not sure if the Docker Compose deployment type is the right for you? Learn more about the various Sourcegraph deployment types in our [Deployment overview section](../index.md).

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed (also see [Docker Compose Requirements](#requirements))
- Use the [resource estimator](../resource_estimator.md) to ensure your machine has sufficient capacity.
- [Sourcegraph license](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing/). You can run through these instructions without one, but you must obtain a license for instances of more than 10 users.

> WARNING: Running Sourcegraph on Windows is not supported for production deployments. Running Sourcegraph on ARM / ARM64 images is not supported for production deployments.

## Requirements

Our Docker Compose support also has the following requirements:

- Minimum Docker version: [v20.10.0](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/#20100)
- Minimum version of Docker Compose: [v1.29.0](https://docs.docker.com/compose/release-notes/#1290) (this is the first version that supports the `service_completed_successfully` dependency condition)
- Docker Compose deployments should only be deployed with [one of our supported installation methods](#installation), and *not* Docker Swarm


## Installation

### Reference Repository

We **strongly** recommend that you create and run Sourcegraph from your own fork of the [`sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker` reference repository](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/) to track customizations to the [Sourcegraph Docker Compose YAML](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/blob/master/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml). 

This repository contains everything you need to install and [configure](#configuration) a Docker Compose Sourcegraph instance, and will make [upgrades](#upgrade-and-migration) far easier.

The sections below cover the process to [create a fork](#create-a-fork), [clone](#clone-your-fork), [configure a release branch](#configure-release-branch), and [make YAML customizations](#make-yaml-customizations). Once completed you'll be ready to [run](#run-sourcegraph) Sourcegraph.

#### Create a fork

[Create a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) of the [sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/) [reference repository](#reference-repository).

> WARNING: Set your fork to **private** if you plan to store secrets (SSL certificates, external Postgres credentials, etc.) within the repository.

#### Clone your fork

Clone your fork using the repository's URL.

> NOTE: The `docker-compose.yaml` file currently depends on configuration files which live in the repository, so you must have the entire repository cloned onto your server.

  ```bash
  git clone $FORK_URL
  ```

#### Configure release branch

Add the [reference repository](#reference-repository)  as an `upstream` remote so that you can [get updates](#upgrade-and-migration).

  ```bash
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker
  ```

Create a `release` branch to track all of your customizations to Sourcegraph. This branch will be used to [upgrade Sourcegraph](#upgrade-and-migration) and install your Sourcegraph instance.

  ```bash
  # Specify the version you want to install
  export SOURCEGRAPH_VERSION="v3.39.1"
  # Check out the selected version for use, in a new branch called "release"
  git checkout $SOURCEGRAPH_VERSION -b release
  ```

#### Make YAML customizations

- Make and [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) customizations to the [Sourcegraph Docker Compose YAML](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/blob/master/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml) to your `release` branch.

### Run Sourcegraph

```bash
# Move into configuration directory
cd deploy-sourcegraph-docker/docker-compose
# Spin up Sourcegraph!
docker-compose up -d
```

Once the server is ready (the `sourcegraph-frontend-0` service is healthy when running `docker ps`), navigate to the hostname or IP address on port `80`.  Create the admin account, then you'll be guided through setting up Sourcegraph for code searching and navigation.

### Cloud installation

You can also deploy Sourcegraph with Docker Compose to a cloud of your choice.

You will need:

- A dedicated host for use with Sourcegraph.
  - Use the [resource estimator](../resource_estimator.md) to ensure you provision enough capacity.
  - Sourcegraph requires SSD backed storage.
  - The configured host must have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (also see [Docker Compose Requirements](#docker-compose)).
- [Sourcegraph license](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing/). You can run through these instructions without one, but you must obtain a license for instances of more than 10 users.

We offer cloud-specific Sourcegraph installation guides:

- [Deploy Sourcegraph with Docker Compose on Amazon Web Services](../../deploy/docker-compose/aws.md)
- [Deploy Sourcegraph with Docker Compose on Google Cloud](../../deploy/docker-compose/google_cloud.md)
- [Deploy Sourcegraph with Docker Compose on DigitalOcean](../../deploy/docker-compose/digitalocean.md)

For next steps and further configuration options, visit the [site administration documentation](../../index.md).

## Configuration

The following section represents a number of key configuration items for your deployment. For more detailed configuration, see Sourcegraph's [configuration](../../config/index.md) docs.

### Enable tracing

To enable [tracing](../../observability/tracing.md), add `SAMPLING_STRATEGIES_FILE=/etc/jaeger/sampling_strategies.json` to the `jaeger` container:

```yaml
jaeger:
  container_name: jaeger
  # ...
  environment:
    - 'SAMPLING_STRATEGIES_FILE=/etc/jaeger/sampling_strategies.json'
```
### Git configuration

#### Git SSH configuration

Provide your `gitserver` instance with your SSH / Git configuration (e.g. `.ssh/config`, `.ssh/id_rsa`, `.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, and `.ssh/known_hosts`--but you can also provide other files like `.netrc`, `.gitconfig`, etc. if needed) by mounting a directory that contains this configuration into the `gitserver` container.

For example, in the `gitserver-0` container configuration in your docker-compose.yaml file, add the second volume listed below, replacing `~/path/on/host/` with the path on the host machine to the `.ssh` directory:

```yaml
gitserver-0:
  container_name: gitserver-0
  ...
  volumes:
    - 'gitserver-0:/data/repos'
    - '~/path/on/host/.ssh:/home/sourcegraph/.ssh'
  ...
```

> WARNING: The permission of your SSH / Git configuration must be set to be readable by the user in the `gitserver` container. For example, run `chmod -v -R 600 ~/path/to/.ssh` in the folder on the host machine.

#### Git HTTP(S) authentication

The easiest way to specify HTTP(S) authentication for repositories is to include the username and password in the clone URL itself, such as `https://user:password@example.com/my/repo`. These credentials won't be displayed to non-admin users.

Otherwise, follow the steps above for mounting SSH configuration to mount a host directory containing the desired `.netrc` file to `/home/sourcegraph/` in the `gitserver` container.

### Expose debug port

To [generate pprof profiling data](../../pprof.md), you must configure your deployment to expose port 6060 on one of your frontend containers, for example:

```diff
  sourcegraph-frontend-0:
    container_name: sourcegraph-frontend-0
    # ...
+   ports:
+     - '0.0.0.0:6060:6060'
```

For specific ports that can be exposed, see the [debug ports section](../../pprof.md#debug-ports) of Sourcegraphs's [generate pprof profiling data](../../pprof.md) docs.

### Use an external database

The Docker Compose configuration has its own internal PostgreSQL and Redis databases. 

To preserve this data when you kill and recreate the containers, review Sourcegraph's External Services for additional information on how you can [use external services](../../external_services/index.md) for persistence.

### Set environment variables

Add/modify the environment variables to all of the sourcegraph-frontend-* services and the sourcegraph-frontend-internal service in the [Docker Compose YAML](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/blob/master/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml):

```yaml
sourcegraph-frontend-0:
  # ...
  environment:
    # ...
    - (YOUR CODE)
    # ...
```

See ["Environment variables in Compose"](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/) for other ways to pass these environment variables to the relevant services (including from the command line, a .env file, etc.).

## Operations

### Manage storage

The [Sourcegraph Docker Compose definition](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/blob/master/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml) uses [Docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) to store its data. These volumes are stored at `/var/lib/docker/volumes` by [default on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/storage/#choose-the-right-type-of-mount).

Guides for managing cloud storage and backups are available in our [cloud-specific installation guides](./index.md#cloud-installation):

- [Storage and backups for Amazon Web Services](./aws.md#storage-and-backups)
- [Storage and backups for Google Cloud](./google_cloud.md#storage-and-backups)
- [Storage and backups for Digital Ocean](./digitalocean.md#storage-and-backups)

### Access the database

The following command allows a user to shell into a Sourcegraph database container and run `psql` to interact with the container's postgres database:

```bash
docker exec -it pgsql psql -U sg #access pgsql container and run psql
docker exec -it codeintel-db psql -U sg #access codeintel-db container and run psql
```
### Database Migrations

> NOTE: The `migrator` service is only available in versions `3.37` and later.

The `frontend` container in the `docker-compose.yaml` file will automatically run on startup and migrate the databases if any changes are required, however administrators may wish to migrate their databases before upgrading the rest of the system when working with large databases. Sourcegraph guarantees database backward compatibility to the most recent minor point release so the database can safely be upgraded before the application code.

To execute the database migrations independently, follow the [docker-compose instructions on how to manually run database migrations](../../how-to/manual_database_migrations.md#docker-compose). Running the `up` (default) command on the `migrator` of the *version you are upgrading to* will apply all migrations required by the next version of Sourcegraph.

### Backup and restore

The following instructions are specific to backing up and restoring the sourcegraph databases in a Docker Compose deployment. These do not apply to other deployment types.

> WARNING: **Only core data will be backed up**.
>
> These instructions will only back up core data including user accounts, configuration, repository-metadata, etc. Other data will be regenerated automatically:
>
> - Repositories will be re-cloned
> - Search indexes will be rebuilt from scratch
>
> The above may take a while if you have a lot of repositories. In the meantime, searches may be slow or return incomplete results. This process rarely takes longer than 6 hours and is usually **much** faster.

#### Back up sourcegraph databases

These instructions will back up the primary `sourcegraph` database and the [codeintel](../../../code_intelligence/index.md) database.

1. `ssh` from your local machine into the machine hosting the `sourcegraph` deployment
2. `cd` to the `deploy-sourcegraph-docker/docker-compose` directory on the host
3. Verify the deployment is running:

```bash
docker-compose ps
          Name                         Command                       State                                                           Ports

```
4. Stop the deployment, and restart the databases service only to ensure there are no other connections during backup and restore.

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose -f db-only-migrate.docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

5. Generate the database dumps

```bash
docker exec pgsql sh -c 'pg_dump -C --username sg sg' > sourcegraph_db.out
docker exec codeintel-db -c 'pg_dump -C --username sg sg' > codeintel_db.out
```

6. Ensure the `sourcegraph_db.out` and `codeintel_db.out` files are moved to a safe and secure location. 

#### Restoring sourcegraph databases into a new environment

The following instructions apply **only if you are restoring your databases into a new deploymentâ€¢â€¢ of sourcegraph ie: a new virtual machine 

If you are restoring a previously running environment, see the instructions for [restoring a previously running deployment](#restoring-sourcegraph-databases-into-an-existing-environment)

1. Copy the database dump files into the `deploy-sourcegraph-docker/docker-compose` directory. 
2. Start the database services

```bash
docker-compose -f db-only-migrate.docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

3. Copy the database files into the containers

```bash
docker cp sourcegraph_db.out pgsql:/tmp/sourecgraph_db.out
docker cp codeintel_db.out codeintel-db:/tmp/codeintel_db.out
```

4. Restore the databases

```bash
docker exec pgsql sh -c 'psql -v ERROR_ON_STOP=1 --username sg -f /tmp/sourcegraph_db.out sg'
docker exec codeintel-db sh -c 'psql -v ERROR_ON_STOP=1 --username sg -f /tmp/condeintel_db.out sg'
```

5. Start the remaining sourcegraph services

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

6. Verify the deployment has started 

```bash 
docker-compose ps

7. Browse to your sourcegraph deployment, login and verify your existing configuration has been restored


#### Restoring sourcegraph databases into an existing environment

1. `cd` to the `deploy-sourcegraph-docker/docker-compose` and stop the previous deployment and remove any existing volumes
```bash
docker-compose down
docker volume rm docker-compose_pgsql
docker volume rm docker-compose_codeintel-db
```

2. Start the databases services only
```bash
docker-compose -f db-only-migrate.docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

3. Copy the database files into the containers

```bash
docker cp sourcegraph_db.out pgsql:/tmp/sourecgraph_db.out
docker cp codeintel_db.out codeintel-db:/tmp/codeintel_db.out
```

4. Restore the databases

```bash
docker exec pgsql sh -c 'psql -v ERROR_ON_STOP=1 --username sg -f /tmp/sourcegraph_db.out sg'
docker exec codeintel-db sh -c 'psql -v ERROR_ON_STOP=1 --username sg -f /tmp/condeintel_db.out sg'
```

5. Start the remaining sourcegraph services

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

6. Verify the deployment has started 

```bash 
docker-compose ps
          Name                         Command                       State                                                           Ports

7. Browse to your sourcegraph deployment, login and verify your existing configuration has been restored

## Monitoring

You can monitor the health of a deployment in several ways:

- Using [Sourcegraph's built-in observability suite](../../observability/index.md), which includes dashboards and alerting for Sourcegraph services.
- Using [`docker ps`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/) to check on the status of containers within the deployment (any tooling designed to work with Docker containers and/or Docker Compose will work too).
  - This requires direct access to your instance's host machine.

## Upgrade

If you [configured Docker Compose with a release branch](#configure-release-branch), when you upgrade you can merge the corresponding upstream release tag into your `release` branch.

```bash
# fetch updates
git fetch upstream
# merge the upstream release tag into your release branch
git checkout release
git merge v$SOURCEGRAPH_VERSION
```

Address any merge conflicts you might have.

> NOTE: If you have made no changes or only very minimal changes to your configuration, you can also ask git to always select incoming changes in the event of merge conflicts:
>
> `git merge -X theirs v$SOURCEGRAPH_VERSION`
>
> If you do this, make sure to validate your configuration is correct before proceeding.

If you are upgrading a live deployment, make sure to check the [release upgrade notes](../../updates/docker_compose.md) for any additional actions you need to take **before proceeding**.

Download all the latest docker images to your local docker daemon:

```bash
docker-compose pull --include-deps
```
Then, ensure that the current Sourcegraph instance is completely stopped:

```bash
docker-compose down --remove-orphans
```

**Once the instance has fully stopped**, you can then start Docker Compose again, now using the latest contents of the Sourcegraph configuration:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
