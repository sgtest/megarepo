# Migrating to Sourcegraph 3.31.x

> NOTE: The following applies only users that use our built-in databases. Users that use external databases (e.x: Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, etc.) are not affected, and can ignore this page.

In Sourcegraph 3.31.x, both the **built-in** main Postgres (`pgsql`) and codeintel (`codeintel-db`) databases have switched to an alpine-based Docker image. Upon upgrading, Sourcegraph will need to re-index the entire database. This process requires some preparation, so please read through **all** of the instructions on the rest of the page beforehand.

## Preparations

### Check for prior index corruption before upgrading

There is a possibility that prior Sourcegraph upgrades inadvertently introduced a major glibc change. This can cause corruption in indexes that have collatable key columns (e.g. any index with a `text` column). Read more about this [here](https://postgresql.verite.pro/blog/2018/08/27/glibc-upgrade.html).

If your index is corrupt, then there is also a possibility that there is bad data in your database that would cause the re-indexing process (and thus the 3.31.x upgrade) to fail. In order to check for corrupt indexes, please run the following SQL query against **both** of the following instances **before** upgrading to 3.31.x:

1. `pgsql`
2. `codeintel-db`

```sql
create extension amcheck;

select bt_index_parent_check(c.oid, true), c.relname, c.relpages
from pg_index i
join pg_opclass op ON i.indclass[0] = op.oid
join pg_am am ON op.opcmethod = am.oid
join pg_class c ON i.indexrelid = c.oid
join pg_namespace n ON c.relnamespace = n.oid
where am.amname = 'btree'
-- Don't check temp tables, which may be from another session:
and c.relpersistence != 't'
-- Function may throw an error when this is omitted:
and i.indisready AND i.indisvalid;
```

If no errors are reported, then your indexes are not corrupted. You can proceed to ["Prepare for downtime"](#prepare-for-downtime).

If any errors are reported, please contact customer support to help you repair your database.

### Prepare for downtime

For systems with large datasets, re-indexing can take **1-2+ hours**.

**Sourcegraph will be unavailable until the re-indexing process has completed.** If the database containers are restarted/killed during the re-indexing process (for example, as a result of automated deployments), re-indexing will have to start over from scratch. Please plan accordingly, and communicate this downtime to your users.
