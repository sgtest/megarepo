# nginx HTTP server settings

Sourcegraph uses [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) to proxy HTTP traffic between clients and the Sourcegraph HTTP server. It ships with a default nginx configuration that is intended for local/internal network usage.

## Let's Encrypt

[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) automatically provisions TLS certificates so that your server is accessible via HTTPS. You can configure it with nginx using EFF's [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/), which has instructions for most common setups:

- [Using Let's Encrypt with nginx on Ubuntu 18.04](https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/ubuntubionic-nginx)
- [Using Let's Encrypt with nginx on Ubuntu 16.04](https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/ubuntuxenial-nginx)
- [Using Let's Encrypt with nginx on Debian 9](https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/debianstretch-nginx)
- [Using Let's Encrypt with nginx on CentOS/RHEL 7](https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/centosrhel7-nginx)
- [Using Let's Encrypt with nginx on macOS](https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/osx-nginx)

Use the dropdown menus on the Certbot site to find instructions for other setups.

## Redirect to external HTTPS URL

The URL that clients should use to access Sourcegraph is called the [`externalURL`](site_config/all.md#externalurl-string) in site configuration. To enforce that clients access Sourcegraph via this URL (and not some other URL, such as an IP address or other non-`https` URL), add the following to `nginx.conf` (replacing `https://sourcegraph.example.com` with your external URL):

``` nginx
# Redirect non-HTTPS traffic to HTTPS.
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;

    # Uncomment this block if you are using Let's Encrypt (otherwise it will be unable to
    # communicate with your server to generate the TLS certificate).
    #
    # location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
    #    try_files $uri =404;
    # }

    location / {
        # REPLACE https://sourcegraph.example.com with your external URL:
        return 301 https://sourcegraph.example.com$request_uri;
    }
}
```

## HTTP Strict Transport Security

[HTTP Strict Transport Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) instructs web clients to only communicate with the server over HTTPS. To configure it, add the following to `nginx.conf` (in the `server` block):

``` nginx
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
```

See [`add_header` documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_headers_module.html#add_header) and "[Configuring HSTS in nginx](https://www.nginx.com/blog/http-strict-transport-security-hsts-and-nginx/)" for more details.
