# Install Sourcegraph with Docker Compose on Digital Ocean

This tutorial shows you how to deploy Sourcegraph via [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to a single Droplet running on DigitalOcean.

> NOTE: Trying to decide how to deploy Sourcegraph? See [our recommendations](../index.md) for how to chose a deployment type that suits your needs.

---

## (optional, recommended) Create a fork for customizations

We **strongly** recommend that you create your own fork of [sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/) to track customizations to the [Sourcegraph Docker Compose yaml](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/blob/master/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml). This will make upgrades far easier.

See ["Store customizations in a fork"](./index.md#optional-recommended-store-customizations-in-a-fork) for full instructions.

## Run Sourcegraph on a Digital Ocean Droplet

* [Create a new Digital Ocean Droplet](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new).

  * Set the operating system to be **Ubuntu 18.04**.
  * For droplet size: use the [resource estimator](../resource_estimator.md) to find a good starting point for your deployment.
  * (**optional, recommended**) Set up SSH access (Authentication > SSH keys) for convenient access to the droplet.
  * (**optional, recommended**) Check the "Enable backups" checkbox to enable weekly backups of all your data.

* In the "Select additional options" section of the Droplet creation page, select the "User Data" and "Monitoring" boxes,
   and paste the following script in the "`Enter user data here...`" text box:
  * (optional) If you [created a fork as recommended above](#optional-recommended-create-a-fork-for-customizations), update the following environment variables in the script below:
    * `DEPLOY_SOURCEGRAPH_DOCKER_FORK_CLONE_URL`: Your fork's git clone URL
    * `DEPLOY_SOURCEGRAPH_DOCKER_FORK_REVISION`: The git revision containing your fork's customizations to the base Sourcegraph Docker Compose yaml. Most likely, `DEPLOY_SOURCEGRAPH_DOCKER_FORK_REVISION='release'` if you followed our branching recommendations in ["Store customizations in a fork"](./index.md#optional-recommended-store-customizations-in-a-fork).

```bash

# Install Docker

## finally, restart Docker daemon to pick up our changes
sudo systemctl restart --now docker

# Install Docker Compose
curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/${DOCKER_COMPOSE_VERSION}/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
curl -L "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/compose/${DOCKER_COMPOSE_VERSION}/contrib/completion/bash/docker-compose" -o /etc/bash_completion.d/docker-compose

# Run Sourcegraph. Restart the containers upon reboot.
cd "${DEPLOY_SOURCEGRAPH_DOCKER_CHECKOUT}"/docker-compose
docker-compose up -d
```

* Click on "Add Volume" and add new block storage with the following settings:

  * **Size**: We recommend > 250 GB. *(As a rule of thumb, Sourcegraph needs at least as much space as all your repositories combined take up. Allocating as much disk space as you can upfront helps you avoid needing to select a droplet with a larger root disk later on.)*
  * Under **Chose configuration options**, select "Manually Format and Mount"

* You may have to wait a minute or two for the instance to finish initializing before Sourcegraph becomes accessible. You can monitor the status by SSHing into the Droplet and running the following diagnostic commands:

```bash
# Follow the status of the user data script you provided earlier
tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log

# (Once the user data script completes) monitor the health of the "sourcegraph-frontend" container
docker ps --filter="name=sourcegraph-frontend-0"
```

* Navigate to the droplet's IP address to finish initializing Sourcegraph. If you have configured a DNS entry for the IP, configure `externalURL` to reflect that.

### After initialization

After initial setup, we recommend you do the following:

* Restrict the accessibility of ports other than `80` and `443` via [Cloud
  Firewalls](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/firewalls/quickstart/).
* Set up [TLS/SSL](../../../admin/http_https_configuration.md#sourcegraph-via-docker-compose-caddy-2)) in the Docker Compose deployment

## Update your Sourcegraph version

To update to the most recent version of Sourcegraph (X.Y.Z), SSH into your instance and run the following:

```bash
cd /root/deploy-sourcerph-docker/docker-compose
git pull
git checkout vX.Y.Z
docker-compose up -d
```

## Storage and Backups

The [Sourcegraph Docker Compose definition](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/blob/master/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml) uses [Docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) to store its data. The script above [configures Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-configuration-file) to store all Docker data on the additional block storage volume that was attached to the droplet (mounted at `/mnt/docker-data` - the volumes themselves are stored under `/mnt/docker-data/volumes`) There are a few different ways to backup this data:

* (**recommended**) The most straightfoward method to backup this data is to [snapshot the entire `/mnt/docker-data` block storage volume on an automatic scheduled basis](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/snapshots/).

* Using an external Postgres instance (see below) lets a service such as [Digital Ocean's Managed Database for Postgres](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-postgresql/) take care of backing up all of Sourcegraph's user data for you. If the droplet running Sourcegraph ever dies or is destroyed, creating a fresh droplet that's connected to that external Postgres will leave Sourcegraph in the same state that it was before.

## Using an external database for persistence

The Docker Compose configuration has its own internal PostgreSQL and Redis databases. To preserve this data when you kill and recreate the containers, you can [use external databases](../../external_database.md) for persistence, such as [Digital Ocean Managed Databases](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases/) for [Postgres](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-postgresql/) and [Redis](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-redis/).

> NOTE: Use of external databases requires [Sourcegraph Enterprise](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing).
