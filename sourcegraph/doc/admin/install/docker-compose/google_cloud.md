# Install Sourcegraph with Docker Compose on Google Cloud

This tutorial shows you how to deploy Sourcegraph via [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to a single node running on Google Cloud.

> NOTE: Trying to decide how to deploy Sourcegraph? See [our recommendations](../index.md) for how to chose a deployment type that suits your needs.

---

## (optional, recommended) Create a fork for customizations

We **strongly** recommend that you create your own fork of [sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/) to track customizations to the [Sourcegraph Docker Compose yaml](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/blob/master/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml). This will make upgrades far easier.

See ["Store customizations in a fork"](./index.md#optional-recommended-store-customizations-in-a-fork) for full instructions.

## Deploy to Google Cloud VM

* [Open your Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances) to create a new VM instance and click **Create Instance**
* Choose an appropriate machine type (use the [resource estimator](../resource_estimator.md) to find a good starting point for your deployment).
* Under the "Boot Disk" options, select the following:
  
  * **Operating System**: Ubuntu
  * **Version**: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
  * **Boot disk type**: SSD persistent disk

* Check the boxes for **Allow HTTP traffic** and **Allow HTTPS traffic** in the **Firewall** section
* Open the **Management, disks, networking, and SSH keys** dropdown section
* Under the **Management** section, add the following in the **Startup script** field:
  * (optional) If you [created a fork as recommended above](#optional-recommended-create-a-fork-for-customizations), update the following environment variables in the script below:
    * `DEPLOY_SOURCEGRAPH_DOCKER_FORK_CLONE_URL`: Your fork's git clone URL
    * `DEPLOY_SOURCEGRAPH_DOCKER_FORK_REVISION`: The git revision containing your fork's customizations to the base Sourcegraph Docker Compose yaml. Most likely, `DEPLOY_SOURCEGRAPH_DOCKER_FORK_REVISION='release'` if you followed our branching recommendations in ["Store customizations in a fork"](./index.md#optional-recommended-store-customizations-in-a-fork).

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# 🚨 Update these variables with the correct values from your fork!

DEPLOY_SOURCEGRAPH_DOCKER_FORK_REVISION='v3.14.2'

# Install git

# Clone Docker Compose definition
git clone "${DEPLOY_SOURCEGRAPH_DOCKER_FORK_CLONE_URL}" "${DEPLOY_SOURCEGRAPH_DOCKER_CHECKOUT}"
cd "${DEPLOY_SOURCEGRAPH_DOCKER_CHECKOUT}"
git checkout "${DEPLOY_SOURCEGRAPH_DOCKER_FORK_REVISION}"

# Format (if necessary) and mount GCP persistent disk
device_fs=$(sudo lsblk "${PERSISTENT_DISK_DEVICE_NAME}" --noheadings --output fsType)
if [ "${device_fs}" == "" ] ## only format the volume if it isn't already formatted
then
    sudo mkfs.ext4 -m 0 -E lazy_itable_init=0,lazy_journal_init=0,discard "${PERSISTENT_DISK_DEVICE_NAME}"
fi
sudo mkdir -p "${DOCKER_DATA_ROOT}"
sudo mount -o discard,defaults "${PERSISTENT_DISK_DEVICE_NAME}" "${DOCKER_DATA_ROOT}"

# Mount GCP disk on reboots
DISK_UUID=$(sudo blkid -s UUID -o value "${PERSISTENT_DISK_DEVICE_NAME}")
sudo echo "UUID=${DISK_UUID}  ${DOCKER_DATA_ROOT}  ext4  discard,defaults,nofail  0  2" >> '/etc/fstab'
umount "${DOCKER_DATA_ROOT}"
mount -a

# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt-get update -y

then
    mkdir -p $(dirname "${DOCKER_DAEMON_CONFIG_FILE}")
    echo '{}' > "${DOCKER_DAEMON_CONFIG_FILE}"
fi

## update Docker's 'data-root' to point to our mounted disk
tmp_config=$(mktemp)
trap "rm -f ${tmp_config}" EXIT
sudo cat "${DOCKER_DAEMON_CONFIG_FILE}" | sudo jq --arg DATA_ROOT "${DOCKER_DATA_ROOT}" '.["data-root"]=$DATA_ROOT' > "${tmp_config}"
sudo cat "${tmp_config}" > "${DOCKER_DAEMON_CONFIG_FILE}"

## finally, restart Docker daemon to pick up our changes
sudo systemctl restart --now docker

# Install Docker Compose
curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/${DOCKER_COMPOSE_VERSION}/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
curl -L "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/compose/${DOCKER_COMPOSE_VERSION}/contrib/completion/bash/docker-compose" -o /etc/bash_completion.d/docker-compose

# Run Sourcegraph. Restart the containers upon reboot.
cd "${DEPLOY_SOURCEGRAPH_DOCKER_CHECKOUT}"/docker-compose
docker-compose up -d
```

* Under the **Disks** section, click **Add new disk**  and add a disk (for storing Docker data) with the following settings:
  * **Type**: SSD Persistent Disk
  * **Description**: "Disk for storing Docker data for Sourcegraph" (or something similarly descriptive)
  * **(optional, recommended) Snapshot schedule**: The most straightfoward way of automatically backing Sourcegraph's data is to set up a [snapshot schedule](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/scheduled-snapshots) for this disk. We strongly recommend that you take the time to do so here.
  * **Mode**: Read/write
  * **Deletion rule**: Keep disk
  * **Size**: `250` GB minimum *(As a rule of thumb, Sourcegraph needs at least as much space as all your repositories combined take up. Allocating as much disk space as you can upfront helps you avoid [resizing this disk](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk#resize_pd) later on.)*

* Create your VM, then navigate to its public IP address.
* If you have configured a DNS entry for the IP, configure `externalURL` to reflect that.
* You may have to wait a minute or two for the instance to finish initializing before Sourcegraph becomes accessible. You can monitor the status by SSHing into the instance and running the following diagnostic commands:
  
```bash
# Follow the status of the user data script you provided earlier
tail -c +0 -f /var/log/syslog | grep startup-script

# (Once the user data script completes) monitor the health of the "sourcegraph-frontend" container
docker ps --filter="name=sourcegraph-frontend-0"
```

## Update your Sourcegraph version

To update to the most recent version of Sourcegraph (X.Y.Z), SSH into your instance and run the following:

```bash
cd /root/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/docker-compose
git pull
git checkout vX.Y.Z
docker-compose up -d
```

---

## Storage and Backups

The [Sourcegraph Docker Compose definition](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker/blob/master/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml) uses [Docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) to store its data. The script above [configures Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-configuration-file) to store all Docker data on the additional persistent disk that was attached to the instance (mounted at `/mnt/docker-data` - the volumes themselves are stored under `/mnt/docker-data/volumes`) There are a few different ways to backup this data:

* (**recommended**) The most straightfoward method to backup this data is to [snapshot the entire `/mnt/docker-data` persistsent disk](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/create-snapshots) on an [automatic, scheduled basis](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/scheduled-snapshots). The directions above tell you how to set up this schedule when the instance is first created, but you can also [create the schedule afterwards](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/scheduled-snapshots).

* Using an external Postgres instance (see below) lets a service such as [Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/) take care of backing up all of Sourcegraph's user data for you. If the VM instance running Sourcegraph ever dies or is destroyed, creating a fresh instance that's connected to that external Postgres will leave Sourcegraph in the same state that it was before.

## Using an external database for persistence

The Docker Compose configuration has its own internal PostgreSQL and Redis databases. To preserve this data when you kill and recreate the containers, you can [use external services](../../external_services/index.md) for persistence, such as Google Cloud's [Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/), [Cloud Memorystore](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/), and [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) for storing user uploads.

> NOTE: Use of external databases requires [Sourcegraph Enterprise](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing).
