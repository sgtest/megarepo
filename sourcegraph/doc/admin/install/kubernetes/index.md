# Sourcegraph with Kubernetes

<p class="lead">
Deploying Sourcegraph on Kubernetes is for organizations that need highly scalable and
available code search and code intelligence.

Not sure if Kubernetes is the right choice for you? Learn more about the various [Sourcegraph installation options](../index.md).

## Installation

Before you get started, we recommend [learning about how Sourcegraph with Kubernetes works](#about).

In addition to the requirements in the [about](#about) section, we recommend reading [configuration guide](configure.md) 
ensuring you have prepared the items below to ensure you're ready to start your installation. 

 - [Customizations](./overlays.md)
 - [Storage class](./configure.md#configure-a-storage-class)
 - [Network Acess](./configure.md#security-configure-network-access)
 - [PostgreSQL Database](./configure.md#sourcegraph-databases)
 - [Scaling services](./scale.md#tuning-replica-counts-for-horizontal-scalability)
 - [Cluster role administrator access](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)

### Steps

1. After meeting all the requirements, make sure you can [access your cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/access-cluster/) with `kubectl`.

```bash
kubectl version
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"21", GitVersion:"v1.21.0", GitCommit:"cb303e613a121a29364f75cc67d3d580833a7479", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2021-04-08T16:31:21Z", GoVersion:"go1.16.1", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"20+", GitVersion:"v1.20.8-gke.900", GitCommit:"28ab8501be88ea42e897ca8514d7cd0b436253d9", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2021-06-30T09:23:36Z", GoVersion:"go1.15.13b5", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
```

```bash
# Google Cloud Platform (GCP) users are required to give their user the ability to create roles in Kubernetes.
# See the [GCP's documentation: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/role-based-access-control#prerequisites_for_using_role-based_access_control
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \
    --clusterrole cluster-admin --user $(gcloud config get-value account)
```

2) `cd` to the forked local copy of [deploy-sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph) repository previously setup during [configuration](./configure.md#getting-started):

```bash
# ðŸš¨ The master branch tracks development.
# Use the branch of this repository corresponding to the version of Sourcegraph you wish to deploy, e.g. git checkout 3.30
cd deploy-sourcegraph
export SOURCEGRAPH_VERSION="v3.30.3"
git checkout $SOURCEGRAPH_VERSION -b release
```

3) Deploy the desired version of Sourcegraph to your cluster:

```
./kubectl-apply-all.sh
```

4) Monitor the status of the deployment:

```
kubectl get pods -o wide --watch
```

5) After deployment is completed, verify Sourcegraph is running by temporarily making the frontend port accessible:

```
kubectl port-forward svc/sourcegraph-frontend 3080:30080
```

6) Open http://localhost:3080 in your browser and you will see a setup page.


7) ðŸŽ‰ Congrats, you have Sourcegraph up and running!

8) If you previously setup an `ingress-controller`, you can also access your deployment via the `sourcegraph-frontend-ingress`.

Run the following command, and ensure an IP address has been assigned to your ingress resource. Then browse to the IP or configured URL.
```
kubectl get ingress sourcegraph-frontend

NAME                   CLASS    HOSTS             ADDRESS     PORTS     AGE
sourcegraph-frontend   <none>   sourcegraph.com   8.8.8.8     80, 443   1d
```

## Troubleshooting

See the [Troubleshooting docs](troubleshoot.md).

## Updating

- See the [Updating Sourcegraph docs](update.md) on how to upgrade.<br/>
- See the [Updating a Kubernetes Sourcegraph instance docs](../../updates/kubernetes.md) for details on changes in each version to determine if manual migration steps are necessary.

## Cloud installation guides

>**Security note:** If you intend to set this up as a production instance, we recommend you create the cluster in a VPC
>or other secure network that restricts unauthenticated access from the public Internet. You can later expose the
>necessary ports via an
>[Internet Gateway](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html) or equivalent
>mechanism. Take care to secure your cluster in a manner that meets your organization's security requirements.

Follow the instructions linked in the table below to provision a Kubernetes cluster for the
infrastructure provider of your choice, using the recommended node and list types in the
table.

> Note: Sourcegraph can run on any Kubernetes cluster, so if your infrastructure provider is not
> listed, see the "Other" row. Pull requests to add rows for more infrastructure providers are
> welcome!

|Provider|Node type|Boot/ephemeral disk size|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Compute nodes| | |
|[Amazon EKS (better than plain EC2)](eks.md)|m5.4xlarge|N/A|
|[AWS EC2](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/aws/)|m5.4xlarge|N/A|
|[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart)|n1-standard-16|100 GB (default)|
|[Azure](azure.md)|D16 v3|100 GB (SSD preferred)|
|[Other](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/pick-right-solution/)|16 vCPU, 60 GiB memory per node|100 GB (SSD preferred)|


## About

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. Applications are deployed via set a of YAML files to configure the various components (storage, networking, containers). Learn more about Kubernetes [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/).

Our Kubernetes support has the following requirements:

- [Sourcegraph Enterprise license](configure.md#add-license-key). _You can run through these instructions without one, but you must obtain a license for instances of more than 10 users._
- Minimum Kubernetes version: [v1.15](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/06/19/kubernetes-1-15-release-announcement/) and [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) v1.15 or later.

We also recommend familiarizing yourself with the following before proceeding with the install steps:

- [Kubernetes Objects](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/)
  - [Namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/)
- [Role Based Access Control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)
- [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)

### Kustomize

We support the use of [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io) to modify and customize our Kubernetes manifests. Kustomize is a template free way to customize configuration, in a Kubernetes like way with a simple configuration file. For more information about how to use Kustomize with Sourcegraph, see our [overlays guide](./overlays.md). 

### Reference repository

Sourcegraph for Kubernetes is configured using our [`sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph` reference repository](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph/). This repository contains everything you need to [spin up](#installation) and [configure](./configure.md) a Sourcegraph deployment on Kubernetes.
