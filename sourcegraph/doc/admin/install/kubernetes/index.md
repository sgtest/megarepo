# Install Sourcegraph with Kubernetes

Deploying Sourcegraph into a Kubernetes cluster is for organizations that need highly scalable and
available code search and code intelligence.

The Kubernetes manifests for a Sourcegraph on Kubernetes installation are in the repository
 [deploy-sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph).

## Requirements

- [Sourcegraph Enterprise license](configure.md#add-license-key). _You can run through these instructions without one, but you must obtain a license for instances of more than 1.users._
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) v1.15
  - Verify that you have enough capacity by following our [resource allocation guidelines](scale.md)
  - Sourcegraph requires an SSD backed storage class
  - [Cluster role administrator access](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) v1.15 or later (run `kubectl version` for version info)
  - [Configure cluster access](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/access-cluster/) for `kubectl`

> WARNING: You need to create a [fork of our deployment reference.](configure.md#fork-this-repository)

## Steps

1) After meeting all the requirements, make sure you can [access your cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/) with `kubectl`.

```bash
# Google Cloud Platform (GCP) users are required to give their user the ability to create roles in Kubernetes.
# See the [GCP's documentation: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/role-based-access-control#prerequisites_for_using_role-based_access_control
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \
    --clusterrole cluster-admin --user $(gcloud config get-value account)
```

2) Clone the [deploy-sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph) repository and check out the version tag you wish to deploy:

```bash
# ðŸš¨ The master branch tracks development.
# Use the branch of this repository corresponding to the version of Sourcegraph you wish to deploy, e.g. git checkout 3.24
git clone https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph
cd deploy-sourcegraph
export SOURCEGRAPH_VERSION="v3.27.1"
git checkout $SOURCEGRAPH_VERSION
```

3) Configure the `sourcegraph` storage class for the cluster by following ["Configure a storage class"](./configure.md#configure-a-storage-class).

4) **(OPTIONAL)** By default `sourcegraph` will be deployed in the `default` kubernetes namespace. If you wish to deploy `sourcegraph` in a non-default namespace, it is highly recommended you use the provided overlays to ensure updates are made in all manifests correctly. See the ["Overlays docs"](./overlays.md) for full instructions on how to use overlays with Sourcegraph and learn more about ["Use non-default namespace"](./overlays.md#use-non-default-namespace).

5) **(OPTIONAL)** If you want to add a large number of repositories to your instance, you should [configure the number of gitserver replicas](configure.md#configure-gitserver-replica-count) and [the number of indexed-search replicas](configure.md#configure-indexed-search-replica-count) _before_ you continue with the next step. (See ["Tuning replica counts for horizontal scalability"](scale.md#tuning-replica-counts-for-horizontal-scalability) for guidelines.)

6) Deploy the desired version of Sourcegraph to your cluster:

```
./kubectl-apply-all.sh
```

7) Monitor the status of the deployment:

```
kubectl get pods -o wide --watch
```

8) After deployment is completed, verify Sourcegraph is running by temporarily making the frontend port accessible:

```
kubectl port-forward svc/sourcegraph-frontend 3080:30080
```

9) Open http://localhost:3080 in your browser and you will see a setup page.

10) ðŸŽ‰ Congrats, you have Sourcegraph up and running! Now [configure your deployment](configure.md).

### Configuration

See the [Configuration docs](configure.md).

### Overlays

See the [Overlays docs](overlays.md).

### Troubleshooting

See the [Troubleshooting docs](troubleshoot.md).

### Updating

- See the [Updating Sourcegraph docs](update.md) on how to upgrade.<br/>
- See the [Updating a Kubernetes Sourcegraph instance docs](../../updates/kubernetes.md) for details on changes in each version to determine if manual migration steps are necessary.

### Restarting

Some updates, such as changing the `externalURL` for an instance, will require restarting the instance using `kubectl`. To restart, run `kubectl rollout restart deployment sourcegraph-frontend`. If updating the `externalURL` for the instance, only the frontend pods will need to be restarted.

### Cluster-admin privileges

> Note: Not all organizations have this split in admin privileges. If your organization does not then you don't need to
> change anything and can ignore this section.

The default installation has a few manifests that require cluster-admin privileges to apply. We have labelled all resources
with a label indicating if they require cluster-admin privileges or not. This allows cluster admins to install the
manifests that cannot be installed otherwise.

- Manifests deployed by cluster-admin

```bash
./kubectl-apply-all.sh -l sourcegraph-resource-requires=cluster-admin
```

- Manifests deployed by non-cluster-admin

```bash
./kubectl-apply-all.sh -l sourcegraph-resource-requires=no-cluster-admin
```

We also provide an [overlay](overlays.md#non-privileged-overlay) that generates a version of the manifests that does not
require cluster-admin privileges.

## Cloud installation guides

>**Security note:** If you intend to set this up as a production instance, we recommend you create the cluster in a VPC
>or other secure network that restricts unauthenticated access from the public Internet. You can later expose the
>necessary ports via an
>[Internet Gateway](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html) or equivalent
>mechanism. Take care to secure your cluster in a manner that meets your organization's security requirements.


Follow the instructions linked in the table below to provision a Kubernetes cluster for the
infrastructure provider of your choice, using the recommended node and list types in the
table.

> Note: Sourcegraph can run on any Kubernetes cluster, so if your infrastructure provider is not
> listed, see the "Other" row. Pull requests to add rows for more infrastructure providers are
> welcome!
