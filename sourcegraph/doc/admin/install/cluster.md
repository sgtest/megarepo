# Installing Sourcegraph on a cluster

For cluster deployments, we recommend installing Sourcegraph on Kubernetes. See the [deploy-sourcegraph repository](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph) for more information.

If you cannot use Kubernetes or prefer using your own container infrastructure, check out our [pure-Docker deployment reference](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-docker).
