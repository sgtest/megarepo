# Install Sourcegraph with Docker

> NOTE: If you get stuck or need help, [file an issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/new?&title=Improve+Sourcegraph+quickstart+guide), [tweet (@srcgraph)](https://twitter.com/srcgraph) or [email](mailto:support@sourcegraph.com?subject=Sourcegraph%20quickstart%20guide).


It takes less than 5 minutes to install Sourcegraph using Docker. If you've got [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), you're ready to start the server which listens on port `7080` by default.

<!--
  DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO A CODEBLOCK.
  We want line breaks for readability, but backslashes to escape them do not work cross-platform.
  This uses line breaks that are rendered but not copy-pasted to the clipboard.

<pre class="pre-wrap"><code>docker run<span class="virtual-br"></span> --publish 7080:7080 --publish 2633:2633 --rm<span class="virtual-br"></span> --volume ~/.sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph<span class="virtual-br"></span> --volume ~/.sourcegraph/data:/var/opt/sourcegraph<span class="virtual-br"></span> sourcegraph/server:3.0.1</code></pre>

Access the server on port `7080`, then the below screencast will show you how to configure Sourcegraph to search public and private repositories, and enable code intelligence on Sourcegraph and GitHub.com.

Once Sourcegraph has been configured, head to the [site administration documentation](../../index.md) for next steps.

## File system performance on Docker for Mac

There is a [known issue](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/77) in Docker for Mac that causes slower than expected file system performance on volume mounts, which impacts the performance of search and cloning.

To achieve better performance, you can do any of the following:

- For better clone performance, clone the repository on your host machine and then [add it to Sourcegraph Server](../../repo/add.md#add-repositories-already-cloned-to-disk).
- Try adding the `:delegated` suffix the data volume mount. [Learn more](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/1592).
  ```
  --volume ~/.sourcegraph/data:/var/opt/sourcegraph:delegated
  ```
