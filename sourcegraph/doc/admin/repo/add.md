# Add repositories (from code hosts) to Sourcegraph

- [Add repositories from a code host](../external_service/index.md) (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Server, AWS CodeCommit, Phabricator, or Gitolite)
- [Add repositories by Git clone URLs](../external_service/other.md)
- [Add repositories from non-Git code hosts](../external_service/non-git.md)
  - [Add Perforce repositories](perforce.md)
- [Add repositories from the local disk](add_from_local_disk.md)

## Troubleshooting

If your repositories are not showing up:

- On single-node deployments, check the logs from the `sourcegraph/server` Docker container for error messages related to communication with your code host's API.
- On Kubernetes cluster deployments, check the logs from the `repo-updater` pod.
- Check the site admin **Repositories** page on Sourcegraph (and ensure you're logged in as an admin).

If your repositories are showing up but are not cloning or updating from the original Git repository:

- Go to the repository's **Mirroring** settings page and inspect the **Check connection** logs.
