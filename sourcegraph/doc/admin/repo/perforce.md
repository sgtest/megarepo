# Using Perforce depots with Sourcegraph

> NOTE: <span class="badge badge-experimental">Experimental</span> Perforce support is a work in progressâ€”see [known issues and limitations](#known-issues-and-limitations).

Sourcegraph supports [Perforce Helix](https://www.perforce.com/solutions/version-control) depots using [p4-fusion](https://github.com/salesforce/p4-fusion). This creates an equivalent Git repository from a Perforce depot, which can then be indexed by Sourcegraph.

## Add a Perforce code host connection

Perforce depots can be added to a Sourcegraph instance by adding the appropriate [code host connection](../external_service/index.md).

Perforce code host connections are still an experimental feature.
To enable Perforce code host connections, a site admin must:

1. Enable the experimental feature in the [site configuration](../config/site_config.md):

    ```json
    {
      "experimentalFeatures": {
        "perforce": "enabled"
      }
      // ...
    }
    ```
    It is highly recommended that you also enable [file-level permissions](#file-level-permissions) (step 1) at this time.
    <br/>**Save your changes before continuing**.

1. Go to **Site admin > Manage code hosts > Add code host**

    you may need to manually refresh the page in order to display the **Perforce** option.

1. Scroll down the list of supported code hosts and select **Perforce**.

1. Configure which depots are mirrored/synchronized as Git repositories to Sourcegraph:

    - [`depots`](perforce.md#depots)
      
      A list of depot paths that can be either a depot root or an arbitrary subdirectory. **Note**: Only `"local"` type depots are supported.

    - [`p4.user`](perforce.md#p4-user)
      
      The user to be authenticated for `p4` CLI, and should be capable of performing:
      - `p4 login`
      - `p4 trust`
      - and any p4 commands involved with `git p4 clone` and `git p4 sync` for listed `depots`.
           
      If repository permissions are mirrored, the user needs additional ability (aka. "super" access level) to perform the commands:
      - `p4 protects`
      - `p4 groups`
      - `p4 group` 
      - `p4 users`
    - [`p4.passwd`](perforce.md#p4-passwd)
      
      The ticket value to be used for authenticating the `p4.user`. It is recommended to create tickets of users in a group that never expire. Use the command `p4 -u <p4.user> login -p -a` to obtain a ticket value.
      
    - See the [configuration documentation below](#configuration) for other fields you can configure.

1. Configure `fusionClient`:

    ```json
    {
      // ...
      "fusionClient": {
        "enabled": true,
        "lookAhead": 2000
      }
    }
    ```

    > NOTE: While the `fusionClient` configuration is optional, without it the code host connection uses `git p4`, which has performance issues so we strongly recommend `p4-fusion`.

    Details of all `p4-fusion` configuration fields can be seen [here](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@2a716bd70c294acf1b3679b790834c4dea9ea956/-/blob/schema/perforce.schema.json?L84-147).

1. Click **Add repositories**.

Sourcegraph will now talk to the Perforce host and sync the configured `depots` to the Sourcegraph instance.

It's worthwhile to note some limitations of this process:

- When syncing depots either [git p4](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-p4) or [p4-fusion](https://github.com/salesforce/p4-fusion) (recommended) are used to convert Perforce depots into git repositories so that Sourcegraph can index them.
- Rename of a Perforce depot, including changing the depot on the Perforce server or the `repositoryPathPattern` config option, will cause a re-import of the depot.
- Unless [permissions syncing](#repository-permissions) is enabled, Sourcegraph is not aware of the depot permissions, so it can't enforce access restrictions.

## Repository permissions

To enforce repository-level permissions for Perforce depots using [Perforce permissions tables](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/p4_protect.html), include [the `authorization` field](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@2a716bd70c294acf1b3679b790834c4dea9ea956/-/blob/schema/perforce.schema.json?L67-78) in the configuration of the Perforce code host connection you created [above](#add-a-perforce-code-host):

```json
{
  // ...
  "authorization": {}
}
```

Adding the `authorization` field to the code host connection configuration will enable partial parsing of the permissions tables. [Learn more about the partial support of permission table parsing](#known-issues-and-limitations).

### Syncing subdirectories to match permission boundaries

By default Sourcegraph only supports repository-level permissions and does not match the granularity of [Perforce permissions tables](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/p4_protect.html).

If you don't [activate file-level permissions](#file-level-permissions) you should sync subdirectories of a depot using the `depots` configuration that best describes the most concrete path of your permissions boundary.

For example, if your Perforce depot `//depot/Talkhouse` has different permissions for `//depot/Talkhouse/main-dev` and subdirectories `//depot/Talkhouse/rel1.0/front`, `//depot/Talkhouse/rel1.0/back` we recommend setting the following `depots`:

```json
{
  // ...
  "depots": [
    "//depot/Talkhouse/main-dev/",
    "//depot/Talkhouse/rel1.0/front/",
    "//depot/Talkhouse/rel1.0/back/"
  ]
}
```

By configuring each subdirectory that has unique permissions, Sourcegraph is able to recognize and enforce permissions for the sub-directories. You can **NOT** define these permissions as:

```json
{
  // ...
  "depots": [
    "//depot/Talkhouse/main-dev/",
    "//depot/Talkhouse/rel1.0/",
    "//depot/Talkhouse/rel1.0/back/"
  ]
}
```

Since that would override the permissions for the `//depot/Talkhouse/rel1.0/back` depot.

#### Wildcards

[File-level permissions](#file-level-permissions) can handle wildcards in the protections table.
If file-level permissions is not enabled, Sourcegraph provides limited support for `*` and `...` paths, so the workaround of [adding sub-folders as separate repositories](#syncing-subdirectories-to-match-permission-boundaries) for the paths that employ wildcards needs to be followed.

### File-level permissions

File-level permissions make the [syncing of subdirectories to match permission boundaries](#syncing-subdirectories-to-match-permission-boundaries) unnecessary.

To enable file-level permissions:

1. Enable [the feature in the site config](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@2a716bd/-/blob/schema/site.schema.json?L227-249):

    ```json
    {
      // ...
      "experimentalFeatures": {
        "perforce": "enabled",
        "subRepoPermissions": { "enabled": true }
      }
    }
    ```

1. Enable the feature in the code host configuration by adding `subRepoPermissions` to the `authorization` object:

    ```json
    {
      // ...
      "authorization": {
        "subRepoPermissions": true
      }
    }
    ```

1. Save the configuration. Permissions will be synced in the background based on your [Perforce permissions tables](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/p4_protect.html).

### Notes about permissions

- Sourcegraph users are mapped to Perforce users based on their verified email addresses.
- As long as a user has been granted at least `Read` permissions in Perforce they will be able to view content in Sourcegraph.
- As a special case, commits in which a user does not have permissions to read any files are hidden. If a user can read a subset of files in a commit, only those files are shown.
- [The host field from protections are not supported](#known-issues-and-limitations).

## Known issues and limitations

We are actively working to significantly improve Sourcegraph's Perforce support. Please [file an issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues) to help us prioritize any specific improvements you'd like to see.

- Sourcegraph was initially built for Git repositories only, so it exposes Git concepts that are meaningless for converted Perforce depots, such as the commit SHA, branches, and tags.
- The commit messages for a Perforce depot converted to a Git repository have an extra line at the end with Perforce information, such as `[git-p4: depot-paths = "//guest/example_org/myproject/": change = 12345]`.
- [Permissions](#repository-permissions)
  - [File-level permissions](#file-level-permissions) are not supported when syncing permissions via the [code host integration](#add-a-perforce-code-host).
  - The [host field](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/p4_protect.html#Form_Fields_..361) in protections is not supported.
