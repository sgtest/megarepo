# Using Perforce depots with Sourcegraph

Sourcegraph supports [Perforce](https://perforce.com) depots using the [git p4](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-p4) adapter. This creates an equivalent Git repository from a Perforce depot. An experimental feature can be enabled to [configure Perforce depots through the Sourcegraph UI](#add-a-perforce-code-host). For Sourcegraph <3.25.1, Sourcegraph's tool for serving local directories is required - see [adding depots using `src serve-git`](#add-perforce-depos-using-src-serve-git).

## Add a Perforce code host

<span class="badge badge-experimental">Experimental</span> <span class="badge badge-note">Sourcegraph 3.25.1+</span>

Adding Perforce depots as an [external code host](../external_service/index.md) through the UI is an experimental feature. To access this functionality, a site admin must enable the experimental feature in the [site configuration](../config/site_config.md):

```json
{
	"experimentalFeatures": {
		"perforce": "enabled"
  }
  ...
}
```

To connect Perforce to Sourcegraph:

1. Depending on whether you are a site admin or user:
   1. *Site admin*: Go to **Site admin > Manage code hosts > Add code host**
   1. *User*: Go to **Settings > Code host connections**.

        > NOTE: That adding code hosts as a user is currently in private beta.

2. Select **Perforce**.
3. Configure the connection to Perforce using the action buttons above the text field, and additional fields can be added using <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl+Space</kbd> for auto-completion. See the [configuration documentation below](#configuration).
4. Click **Add repositories**.

### Depot syncing

> NOTE: Only "local" type depots are supported.

Use the `depots` field to configure which depots are mirrored/synchronized as Git repositories to Sourcegraph:

- [`depots`](perforce.md#depots)<br>A list of depot paths that can be either a depot root or an arbitrary subdirectory.
- [`p4.user`](perforce.md#p4-user)<br>The user to be authenticated for p4 CLI, and should be capable of performing `p4 ping`, `p4 login`, `p4 trust` and any p4 commands involved with `git p4 clone` and `git p4 sync` for listed `depots`. If repository permissions are mirrored, the user needs additional ability to perform the `p4 protects`, `p4 groups`, `p4 group`, `p4 users` commands (aka. "super" access level).
- [`p4.passwd`](perforce.md#p4-passwd)<br>The ticket value to be used for authenticating the `p4.user`. It is recommended to create tickets of users in a group that never expire. Use the command `p4 -u <p4.user> login -p -a` to obtain a ticket value.

Notable things about depot syncing:

- Depot syncing uses the `git p4` command to convert Perforce depots into git repositories.
- It takes approximately one second to import one Perforce change into a Git commit, this translates to sync a Perforce depot with 1000 changes takes approximately 1000 seconds, which is about 17 minutes. It is possible to limit the maximum changes to import using `maxChanges` config option.
- Rename of a Perforce depot will cause a re-import of the depot, including changing the depot on the Perforce server or the `repositoryPathPattern` config option.

#### Using p4-fusion for faster syncing

We support optionally using the [p4-fusion](https://github.com/salesforce/p4-fusion) tool:

> A fast Perforce depot to Git repository converter using the Helix Core C/C++ API as an attempt to mitigate the performance bottlenecks in git-p4.py.

To use it, configure the `fusionClient` setting in your code host [config](#configuration), for example:

```json
{
    ...
    "fusionClient": {
      "enabled": true,
      "lookAhead": 1000
    }
}
```

Details of all fields can be seen in [here](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@a296019877c36c8e6b641e14ffa711372316788f/-/blob/schema/perforce.schema.json?L89)

### Repository permissions

<span class="badge badge-note">Sourcegraph 3.26+</span>

To enable permissions syncing for Perforce depots using [Perforce permissions tables](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/p4_protect.html), include the `authorization` field:

```json
{
  ...
  "authorization": {}
}
```

> WARNING: Sourcegraph only supports repository-level permissions and does not match the granularity of [Perforce permissions tables](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/p4_protect.html). Some notable disparities include:
>
> - [file-level permissions are not supported](#file-level-permissions). Read on to learn more about the workaround.
> - [the host field from protections are not supported](#known-issues-and-limitations).

> NOTE: We are testing an experimental feature that will allow syncing permissions with full granularity, details [here](#experimental-support-for-path-level-permissions)

Site admins should sync subdirectories of a depot using the `depots` configuration that best describe the most concrete path of your permissions boundary, which can then enforce permissions in Sourcegraph.

For example, if your Perforce depot `//Sourcegraph/` has different permissions for `//Sourcegraph/Backend/` and some subdirectories of `//Sourcegraph/Frontend/`, we recommend setting the following `depots`:

```json
{
  ...
  "depots": [
    "//Sourcegraph/Backend/",
    "//Sourcegraph/Frontend/Web/",
    "//Sourcegraph/Frontend/Extension/"
  ]
}
```

By configuring each subdirectory that has unique permissions, Sourcegraph is able to recognize and enforce permissions for each defined repository. You *cannot* define these permissions as:

```json
{
  ...
  "depots": [
    "//Sourcegraph/Backend/",
    "//Sourcegraph/Frontend/",
    "//Sourcegraph/Frontend/Extension/"
  ]
}
```

as this will override the permissions for the `//Sourcegraph/Frontend/Extension/` depot. [Learn more](#file-level-permissions).

#### Wildcards

<span class="badge badge-note">Sourcegraph 3.31+</span>

Sourcegraph provides limited support for `*` and `...` paths ("wildcards") in [Perforce permissions tables](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/p4_protect.html). For example, the following can be supported using [the workaround described in repository permissions](#repository-permissions):

```sh
write user alice * //TestDepot/...
write user alice * //TestDepot/*/spec/...
write user alice * //TestDepot/.../spec/...
```

> WARNING: Permissions only be enforced per-repository, **not per-file** - [learn more](#file-level-permissions).

#### File-level permissions

> NOTE: See [below](#experimental-support-for-path-level-permissions) for details on experimental support for file level permissions

Sourcegraph does not support file-level permissions, as allowed in [Perforce permissions tables](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/p4_protect.html). That means if a user has access to a directory and also has exclusions to some subdirectories, _those exclusions will not be enforced in Sourcegraph_ because Sourcegraph does not support file-level permissions.

For example, consider the following output of `p4 protects -u alice`:

```text
list user * * -//...
list user * * -//spec/...
write user alice * //TestDepot/...
=write user alice * -//TestDepot/Secret/...
```

If the site admin configures `"depots": ["//TestDepot/"]`, the exclusion of the last line will not be enforced in Sourcegraph. In other words, the user alice _will have access_ to `//TestDepot/Secret/` in Sourcegraph even though alice does not have access to this directory on the Perforce Server.

Since Sourcegraph uses partial matching to determine if a user has access to a repository in Sourcegraph, refer to [the workaround described in repository permissions](#repository-permissions) to mitigate this issue.

### Experimental support for file level permissions

<span class="badge badge-experimental">Experimental</span> <span class="badge badge-note">Sourcegraph insiders</span>

We are working on experimental support for file / path level permissions. In order to opt in you need to enable the experimental feature in site config:

```json
{
	"experimentalFeatures": {
    "perforce": "enabled",
    "subRepoPermissions": { "enabled": true }
  }
}
```

You also need to explicitly enable it for each Perforce code host connection in the `authorisation` section:

```json
{
  "authorization": {
    "subRepoPermissions": true
  }
}
```

Permissions will be synced in the background based on your [Perforce permissions tables](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/p4_protect.html). The mapping between Sourcegraph users and Perforce users are based on matching verified e-mail addresses.

As long as a user has been granted at least `Read` permissions in Perforce they will be able to view content in Sourcegraph.

As a special case, if a user is not allowed to read any file included in a commit, the entire commit will be hidden.

## Add Perforce depots using `src serve-git`

<span class="badge badge-note">Sourcegraph < 3.26</span>

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Perforce `p4` CLI configured to access your Perforce depot
- `git p4` (see "[Adding `git p4` to an existing install](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitP4#Adding_git-p4_to_an_existing_install)")
- [`src serve-git`](../external_service/src_serve_git.md)

### Create an equivalent Git repository and serve it to Sourcegraph

For each Perforce repository you want to use with Sourcegraph, follow these steps:

1. Create a local Git repository with the contents of your Perforce depot: `git p4 clone //DEPOT/PATH@all` (replace `//DEPOT/PATH` with the Perforce repository path).
1. Run `src serve-git` from the parent directory that holds all of the new local Git repositories.
1. Follow the instructions in the [`src serve-git` Quickstart](../external_service/src_serve_git.md#quickstart) to add the repositories to your Sourcegraph instance.

### Updating Perforce depots

To update the repository after new Perforce commits are made, run `git p4 sync` in the local repository directory. These changes will be automatically reflected in Sourcegraph as long as `src serve-git` is running.

We recommend running this command on a periodic basis using a cron job, or some other scheduler. The frequency will dictate how fresh the code is in Sourcegraph, and can range from once every 10s to once per day, depending on how large your codebase is and how long it takes `git p4 sync` to complete.

### Alternative to `src serve-git`: push the new Git repository to a code host

If you prefer, you can skip using `src serve-git`, and instead push the new local Git repository to a Git-based code host of your choice. For updates, you would run `git p4 sync && git push` periodically.

If you do this, the repositories you created on your Git host are normal Git repositories, so you can [add the repositories to Sourcegraph](index.md) as you would any other Git repositories.

### Alternative for extra-large codebases

The instructions below will help you get Perforce depots on Sourcegraph quickly and easily, while retaining all code change history. If your Perforce codebase is large enough that converting it to Git takes long enough to cause noticeable staleness on Sourcegraph, you can use `src-expose`'s [optional syncing functionality](../external_service/non-git.md#syncing-repositories) along with a faster fetching command (like `p4 sync` instead of `git p4 sync`) to periodically fetch and squash changes without trying to preserve the original Perforce history.

## Known issues and limitations

We intend to improve Sourcegraph's Perforce support in the future. Please [file an issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues) to help us prioritize any specific improvements you'd like to see.

- Sourcegraph was initially built for Git repositories only, so it exposes Git concepts that are meaningless for converted Perforce depots, such as the commit SHA, branches, and tags.
- The commit messages for a Perforce depot converted to a Git repository have an extra line at the end with Perforce information, such as `[git-p4: depot-paths = "//guest/example_org/myproject/": change = 12345]`.
- [Permissions](#repository-permissions)
  - [File-level permissions](#file-level-permissions) are not supported when syncing permissions via the [code host integration](#add-a-perforce-code-host).
  - The [host field](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/cmdref/Content/CmdRef/p4_protect.html#Form_Fields_..361) in protections are not supported.
