# Repository metadata

<aside class="experimental">
<span class="badge badge-experimental">Experimental</span> Tagging repositories with key/value pairs is an experimental feature in Sourcegraph 4.0. It's a <b>preview</b> of functionality we're currently exploring to make searching large numbers of repositories easier. To enable this feature, enable the `repository-metadata` feature flag for your org. If you have any feedback, please let us know!
</aside>

Repositories tracked by Sourcegraph can be associated with user-provided key-value pairs. Once this metadata is added, it can be used to filter searches to the subset of matching repositories.

Metadata can be added either as key-value pairs or as tags. Key-value pairs can be searched with the filter `repo:has(mykey:myvalue)`. `repo:has.key(mykey)` can be used to search over repositories with a given key irrespective of its value. Tags are just key-value pairs with a `null` value and can be searched with the filter `repo:has.tag(mytag)`.

## Examples
### Repository owners

One way this feature might be used is to add the owning team of each repository as a key-value pair. For example, the repository `github.com/sourcegraph/security-onboarding` repository is owned by the security team, so we could add `owning-team:security` as a key-value pair on that repository. 

Once those key-value pairs are added, they can be used to filter searches to only the code that is owned by a specific team with a search like `repo:has(owning-team:security) account creation`.

### GitHub topics

Another way this could be used is to ingest GitHub topics as tags so repositories can be searched by GitHub topic. Once ingested, if you wanted to search for repositories with the github topic `machine-learning`, you could run the search `repo:has.tag(machine-learning)`.

## Adding metadata

Currently, there are two ways to add metadata to a repository: Sourcegraph's GraphQL API, and the [`src-cli` command line tool](https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli). 

### Limitations

- There are no scale limits in terms of number of pairs per repo, or number of pairs globally.
- The size of a field is unbounded, but practically it's better to keep it small for performance reasons.
- There are no limits on special characters in the key-value pairs, but in practice we recommend not using special characters because the search query language doesnâ€™t have full support for escaping arbitrary sequences, in particular `:`, `(` and`)`.

### GraphQL

Metadata can be added with the `addRepoKeyValuePair` mutation, updated with the `updateRepoKeyValuePair` mutation, and deleted with the `deleteRepoKeyValuePair` mutation. You will need the GraphQL ID for the repository being targeted.

```graphql
mutation AddSecurityOwner($repoID: ID!) {
  addRepoKeyValuePair(repo: $repoID, key: "owning-team", value: "security") {
    alwaysNil
  }
}

mutation UpdateSecurityOwner($repoID: ID!) {
  updateRepoKeyValuePair(repo: $repoID, key: "owning-team", value: "security++") {
    alwaysNil
  }
}

mutation DeleteSecurityOwner($repoID: ID!) {
  deleteRepoKeyValuePair(repo: $repoID, key: "owning-team") {
    alwaysNil
  }
}
```

### src-cli

Metadata can be added using `src repos add-kvp`, updated using `src repos update-kvp`, and deleted using `src repos delete-kvp`. You will need the GraphQL ID for the repository being targeted.

```text
$ src repos add-kvp -repo=repoID -key=owning-team -value=security
Key-value pair 'owning-team:security' created.

$ src repos update-kvp -repo=repoID -key=owning-team -value=security++
Value of key 'owning-team' updated to 'security++'

$ src repos delete-kvp -repo=repoID -key=owning-team
Key-value pair with key 'owning-team' deleted.
```
