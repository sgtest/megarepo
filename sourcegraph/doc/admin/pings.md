# Pings

Sourcegraph periodically sends a ping to Sourcegraph.com to help our product and customer teams. It sends only the high-level data below. It never sends code, repository names, usernames, or any other specific data. To learn more, go to the **Site admin > Pings** page on your instance. (The URL is `https://sourcegraph.example.com/site-admin/pings`.)

## Critical telemetry

Critical telemetry includes only the high-level data below required for billing, support, updates, and security notices.

- Randomly generated site identifier
- The email address of the initial site installer (or if deleted, the first active site admin), to know who to contact regarding sales, product updates, security updates, and policy updates
- Sourcegraph version string (e.g. "vX.X.X")
- Dependency versions (e.g. "6.0.9" for Redis, or "13.0" for Postgres)
- Deployment type (single Docker image, Docker Compose, Kubernetes cluster, Helm, or pure Docker cluster)
- License key associated with your Sourcegraph subscription
- Aggregate count of current monthly users
- Total count of existing user accounts

## Connections to Sourcegraph.com

Sourcegraph only connects to Sourcegraph.com for two purposes:

1. The pings described above are sent, in order to:
   - Check for new product updates.
   - Send [anonymous, non-specific, aggregate metrics](#pings) back to Sourcegraph.com (see the full list above).
1. [Sourcegraph extensions](../extensions/index.md) are fetched from Sourcegraph.com`s extension registry (unless you are using a [private extension registry](extensions.md#publish-extensions-to-a-private-extension-registry)).

There are no other automatic external connections to Sourcegraph.com (or any other site on the internet).
