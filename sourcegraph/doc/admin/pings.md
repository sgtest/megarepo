# Pings

Sourcegraph periodically sends a ping to Sourcegraph.com to help our product and customer teams. It sends only the high-level data below. It never sends code, repository names, usernames, or any other specific data. To learn more, go to the **Site admin > Pings** page on your instance. (The URL is `https://sourcegraph.example.com/site-admin/pings`.)

- Sourcegraph version string

- Which category of authentication provider is in use (built-in, OpenID Connect, an HTTP proxy, or SAML)
- Whether code intelligence is enabled
- Total count of existing user accounts
