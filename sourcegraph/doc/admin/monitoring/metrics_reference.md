# Sourcegraph monitoring: metrics reference

## High-level alerting metrics

Sourcegraph's metrics include a single high-level metric `alert_count` which indicates the number of `level=critical` and `level=warning` alerts each service has fired over time for each Sourcegraph service. This is the same metric presented on the **Overview** monitoring dashboard:

### `alert_count`

**Description:** The number of alerts each service has fired and their severity level. The severity levels are defined as follows:

- `critical`: something is _definitively_ wrong with Sourcegraph.
  - **Examples:** Database inaccessible, running out of disk space, running out of memory.
  - **Suggested action:** Page a site administrator to investigate.
- `warning`: something _could_ be wrong with Sourcegraph.
  - **Examples:** High latency, high search timeouts.
  - **Suggested action:** Email a site administrator to investigate and monitor when convenient.

**Values:**

- Although the values of `alert_count` are floating-point numbers, only their whole numbers have meaning. For example: `0.5` and `0.7` indicate no alerts are firing, while `1.2` indicates exactly one alert is firing and `3.0` indicates exactly three alerts firing.

**Labels:**

- `level`: either `critical` or `warning`, as defined above.
- `service_name`: the name of the service that fired the alert, one of the following constants:
  - `"frontend"`
  - `"github-proxy"`
  - `"gitserver"`
  - `"lsif-serer"`
  - `"query-runner"`
  - `"replacer"`
  - `"repo-updater"`
  - `"searcher"`
  - `"symbols"`
  - `"zoekt-indexserver"`
  - `"zoekt-webserver"`
  - `"syntect-server"`
- `name`: the name of the alert that the service fired (chosen by the service)
- `description`: a human-readable description of the alert
- `instance`: identifies the Kubernetes pod, Docker container, or host machine from which the alert came.
