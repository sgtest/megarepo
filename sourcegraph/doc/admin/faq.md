# Administration FAQ

## How do I expose my Sourcegraph instance to a different host port when running locally?

Change the `docker` `--publish` argument to make it listen on the specific interface and port on your host machine. For example, `docker run ... --publish 0.0.0.0:80:7080 ...` would make it accessible on port 80 of your machine. For more information, see "[Publish or expose port](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#publish-or-expose-port--p---expose)" in the Docker documentation.

The other option is to deploy and run Sourcegraph on a cloud provider. For an example, see documentation to [deploy to Google Cloud](install/docker/google_cloud.md).

## How do I access the Sourcegraph database?

> NOTE: To execute an SQL query against the database without first creating an interactive session (as below), append `--command "SELECT * FROM users;"` to the `docker container exec` command.

### For single-node deployments (`sourcegraph/server`)

Get the Docker container ID for Sourcegraph:

```bash
docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE
d039ec989761        sourcegraph/server:VERSION
```

Open a PostgreSQL interactive terminal:

```bash
docker container exec -it d039ec989761 psql -U postgres sourcegraph
```

Run your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

### For Kubernetes cluster deployments

Get the id of one `pgsql` Pod:

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=pgsql
NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pgsql-76a4bfcd64-rt4cn   2/2       Running   0          19m
```

Open a PostgreSQL interactive terminal:

```bash
kubectl exec -it pgsql-76a4bfcd64-rt4cn -- psql -U sg
```

Run your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

## How does Sourcegraph store repositories on disk?

Sourcegraph stores bare Git repositories (without a working tree), which is a complete mirror of the repository on your code host.

If you are keen for more details on what bare Git repositories are, [check out this discussion on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/q/5540883).

The directories should contain just a few files and directories, namely: HEAD, config, description, hooks, info, objects, packed-refs, refs

## Does Sourcegraph support svn?

For Subversion and other non-Git code hosts, the recommended way to make these accessible in
Sourcegraph is through [`src-expose`](external_service/other.md#experimental-src-expose).

Alternatively, you can use [`git-svn`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-svn) or
[`svg2git`](https://github.com/svn-all-fast-export/svn2git) to convert Subversion repositories to
Git repositories. Unlike `src-expose`, this will preserve commit history, but is generally much
slower.
