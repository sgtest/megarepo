# GitHub

Site admins can sync Git repositories hosted on [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and [GitHub Enterprise](https://enterprise.github.com) with Sourcegraph so that users can search and navigate the repositories.

To set this up, add GitHub as an external service to Sourcegraph:

1. Go to **User menu > Site admin**.
1. Open the **External services** page.
1. Press **+ Add external service**.
1. Enter a **Display name** (using "GitHub" is OK if you only have one GitHub instance).
1. In the **Kind** menu, select **GitHub**.
1. Configure the connection to GitHub in the JSON editor. Use Cmd/Ctrl+Space for completion, and [see configuration documentation below](#configuration).
1. Press **Add external service**.

## Supported versions

- GitHub.com
- GitHub Enterprise v2.10 and newer

## Repository syncing

By default, Sourcegraph syncs all repositories that are affiliated with the user whose token you provide.

If you want to synchronize public repositories from GitHub.com, the repositories need to be explicitly enumerated in the [`repos`](github.md#configuration) field of the GitHub external service configuration.

If you don't want to use an access token from your personal GitHub user account, generate a token for a [machine user](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#machine-users) affiliated with the organizations whose repositories you wish to make available.

### GitHub.com rate limits

You should always include a token in a configuration for a GitHub.com URL to avoid being denied service by GitHub's [unauthenticated rate limits](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting). If you don't want to automatically synchronize repositories from the account associated with your personal access token, you can create a token without a [`repo` scope](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps/#available-scopes) for the purposes of bypassing rate limit restrictions only.

## Repository permissions

By default, all Sourcegraph users can view all repositories. To configure Sourcegraph to use
GitHub's per-user repository permissions, see "[Repository permissions](../repo/permissions.md#github)".

## User authentication

To configure GitHub as an authentication provider (which will enable sign-in via GitHub), see the
[authentication documentation](../auth.md#github).

## Configuration

GitHub external service connections support the following configuration options, which are specified in the JSON editor in the site admin external services area.
