# GitHub

Site admins can sync Git repositories hosted on [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and [GitHub Enterprise](https://enterprise.github.com) with Sourcegraph so that users can search and navigate the repositories.

There are 2 ways to connect with GitHub:
1. [Using a GitHub App (recommended)](#using-a-github-app)
2. [Using an access token](#using-an-access-token)

## Supported versions

- GitHub.com
- GitHub Enterprise v2.10 and newer

<!-- NOTE: The instructions in the following sections closely mirror those in doc/admin/config/batch_changes.md under "Commit signing for GitHub". When making changes here, be sure to consider if those changes should also be made over there! -->

To create a GitHub App and connect it to Sourcegraph:  

1. Go to **Site admin > Repositories > Github Apps** on Sourcegraph.  

<img alt="The GitHub Apps page on Sourcegraph" src="https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/administration/config/github-apps/github-apps-list.png" class="screenshot theme-light-only" />
<img alt="The GitHub Apps page on Sourcegraph" src="https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/administration/config/github-apps/github-apps-list-dark.png" class="screenshot theme-dark-only" />

2. Click **Create GitHub App**.
3. Enter a name for your app (it must be unique across your GitHub instance) and the URL of your GitHub instance.

    You may optionally specify an organization to register the app with. If no organization is specified, the app will be owned by the account of the user who creates it on GitHub. This is the default.

    You may also optionally set the App visibility to public. A GitHub App must be made public if you wish to install it on multiple organizations or user accounts. The default is private.

<img alt="The GitHub App creation page on Sourcegraph, with the default values filled out" src="https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/administration/config/github-apps/github-apps-create.png" class="screenshot theme-light-only" />
<img alt="The GitHub App creation page on Sourcegraph, with the default values filled out" src="https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/administration/config/github-apps/github-apps-create-dark.png" class="screenshot theme-dark-only" />

4. When you click **Create GitHub App**, you will be redirected to GitHub to confirm the details of the App to be created.

<img alt="The GitHub App creation page on GitHub" src="https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/administration/config/github-apps/github-app-create-on-gh.png" class="screenshot theme-light-only" />
<img alt="The GitHub App creation page on GitHub" src="https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/administration/config/github-apps/github-app-create-on-gh-dark.png" class="screenshot theme-dark-only" />

5. To complete the setup on GitHub, you will be asked to review the App permissions and select which repositories the App can access before installing it in a namespace. The default is **All repositories**. Any repositories that you choose to omit will not be able to be synced by Sourcegraph. You can change this later.

<img alt="The GitHub App installation page on GitHub" src="https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/administration/config/github-apps/github-app-install-gh.png" class="screenshot theme-light-only" />
<img alt="The GitHub App installation page on GitHub" src="https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/administration/config/github-apps/github-app-install-gh-dark.png" class="screenshot theme-dark-only" />

6. Click **Install**. Once complete, you will be redirected back to Sourcegraph, where you will now be able to view and manage the details of your new GitHub App from within Sourcegraph.

<img alt="The GitHub App details page on Sourcegraph" src="https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/administration/config/github-apps/github-app-post-create.png" class="screenshot theme-light-only" />
<img alt="The GitHub App details page on Sourcegraph" src="https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/administration/config/github-apps/github-app-post-create-dark.png" class="screenshot theme-dark-only" />


7. Sourcegraph needs to map Sourcegraph users to GitHub users. Click **Reveal secret** to get the JSON configuration for the auth provider and copy/paste it into the `"auth.providers"` section of your site configuration.
8. Click **Add connection** under your new installation to create a code host connection to GitHub with this App installation. By default, it will sync all repositories the App can access within the namespace where it was installed. Repository permission enforcement will also be turned on by default.

    You can now [select repositories to sync](#selecting-repositories-to-sync) or see more configuration options in the [configuration section](#configuration).

9. (Optional) If you want to sync repositories from other organization or user namespaces and your GitHub App is set to public visibility, you can create additional installations with **Add installation**.

> NOTE: If you are using [Batch Changes](../../batch_changes/index.md), you can create a GitHub App to perform [commit signing](../config/batch_changes.md#commit-signing-for-github) <span class="badge badge-beta">Beta</span>.

### Multiple installations

The initial GitHub App setup will only install the App on the organization or user account that you registered it with. If your code is spread across multiple organizations or user accounts, you will need to create additional installations for each namespace that you want Sourcegraph to sync repositories from.

By default, Sourcegraph creates a private GitHub App, which only allows the App to be installed on the same organization or user account that it was created in. If you did not set the App to public visibility during creation, you will need to [change the visibility](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/maintaining-github-apps/modifying-a-github-app#changing-the-visibility-of-a-github-app) to public before you can install it in other namespaces. For security considerations, see [GitHub's documentation on private vs public apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/setting-up-a-github-app/making-a-github-app-public-or-private).  

Once public, App can be installed in additional namespaces either from Sourcegraph or from GitHub.

#### Installing from Sourcegraph

1. Go to **Site admin > Repositories > Github Apps** and click **Edit** on the App you want to install in another namespace. You'll be taken to the App details page.

<img alt="The GitHub App details page on Sourcegraph" src="https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/administration/config/github-apps/github-app-post-create.png" class="screenshot theme-light-only" />
<img alt="The GitHub App details page on Sourcegraph" src="https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/administration/config/github-apps/github-app-post-create-dark.png" class="screenshot theme-dark-only" />

2. Click **Add installation**. You will be redirected to GitHub to pick which other organization to install the App on and finish the installation process.

    > NOTE: Only [organization owners](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization#organization-owners) can install GitHub Apps on an organization. If you are not an owner, you will need to ask an owner to install the App for you.

<img alt="The GitHub App installation page, with a list of namespaces to select from" src="https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/administration/config/github-apps/github-app-multi-install-gh.png" class="screenshot theme-light-only" />

3. As before, you will be asked to review the App permissions and select which repositories the App can access before installing it in a namespace. Once you click **Install** and the setup completes, you will be redirected back to Sourcegraph, where you will now see your additional installation listed.

<img alt="The GitHub App details page on Sourcegraph, scrolled to show a second new installation" src="https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/administration/config/github-apps/github-app-post-multi-install.png" class="screenshot theme-light-only" />
<img alt="The GitHub App details page on Sourcegraph, scrolled to show a second new installation" src="https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/administration/config/github-apps/github-app-post-multi-install-dark.png" class="screenshot theme-dark-only" />

4. To sync repositories from this installation, click **Add connection** under your new installation.

#### Installing from GitHub

1. Go to the GitHub App page. You can get here easily from Sourcegraph by clicking **View in GitHub** for the App you want to install in another namespace.
2. Click **Configure**, or go to **App settings > Install App**, and select the organization or user account you want to install the App on.
3. As before, you will be asked to review the App permissions and select which repositories the App can access before installing it in a namespace. Once you click **Install** and the setup completes, you will be redirected back to Sourcegraph.
4. GitHub App installations will be automatically synced in the background. Return to **Site admin > Repositories > Github Apps** and click **Edit** on the App you added the new installation for. You'll be taken to the App details page. Once synced, you will see the new installation listed.

<img alt="The GitHub App details page on Sourcegraph, scrolled to show a second new installation" src="https://sourcegraphstatic.com/docs/images/administration/config/github-apps/github-app-post-multi-install.png" class="screenshot theme-light-only" />

5. To sync repositories from this installation, click **Add connection** under your new installation.

### Uninstalling an App

You can uninstall a GitHub App from a namespace or remove it altogether at any time.

To remove an installation in a single namespace, click **View in GitHub** for the installation you want to remove. If you are able to administer Apps in this namespace, you will see **Uninstall "[APP NAME]"** in the "Danger zone" at the bottom of the page. Click **Uninstall** to remove the App from this namespace. Sourcegraph will periodically sync installations in the background. It may temporarily throw errors related to the missing installation until the sync completes. You can check the GitHub App details page to confirm the installation has been removed.

To remove an App entirely, go to **Site admin > Repositories > Github Apps** and click **Remove** for the App you want to remove. You will be prompted to confirm you want to remove the App from Sourcegraph. Once removed from the Sourcegraph side, Sourcegraph will no longer communicate with your GitHub instance via the App unless explicitly reconnected. However, the App will still exist on GitHub unless manually deleted there, as well.

### GitHub App token use

Sourcegraph uses the tokens from GitHub Apps in the following ways:

#### Installation access tokens

Installation access tokens are short-lived, non-refreshable tokens that give Sourcegraph access to the repositories the GitHub App has been given access to. Sourcegraph uses these tokens to clone repositories and to determine which users should be able to view a repository. These tokens expire after 1 hour.

#### User access tokens

These are OAuth tokens that Sourcegraph receives when a user signs into Sourcegraph using the configured GitHub App. Sourcegraph uses these tokens to link the user's Sourcegraph account to their GitHub account, as well as determine which repositories a user should be able to access. These tokens are refreshable, and by default they expire after 8 hours. Sourcegraph refreshes the user tokens as required.

### Custom Certificates

<span class="badge badge-note">Sourcegraph 5.1.5+</span>

If you are using a self-signed certificate for your GitHub Enterprise instance, configure `tls.external` under `experimentalFeatures`
in the **Site configuration** with your certificate(s).

```json
{
  "experimentalFeatures": {
    "tls.external": {
      "certificates": [
        "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n..."
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Using an access token

To connect GitHub to Sourcegraph with an access token:

1. Go to **Site admin > Manage code hosts**
2. Select **GitHub**.
3. Configure the connection to GitHub using the action buttons above the text field, and additional fields can be added using <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl+Space</kbd> for auto-completion. See the [configuration documentation below](#configuration).
4. Press **Add repositories**.

In this example, the kubernetes public repository on GitHub is added by selecting **Add a single repository** and replacing `<owner>/<repository>` with `kubernetes/kubernetes`:

```
{
  "url": "https://github.com",
  "token": "<access token>",
  "orgs": [],
  "repos": [
    "kubernetes/kubernetes"
  ]
}
```

## GitHub API access

GitHub requires a `token` in order to access their API. There are different types of tokens that can be supplied. When using GitHub apps, this is handled automatically by Sourcegraph.

- **[GitHub app installation access token](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-an-installation-access-token-for-a-github-app)**:<br>An installation access token is created automatically when you install a GitHub app. Do not set this token in the code host connection configuration. This token gives Sourcegraph the same level of access to repositories as the GitHub app installation.
- **[Personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)**:<br>This gives Sourcegraph the same level of access to repositories as the account that created the token. If you don't want to mix your personal repositories with your organizations repositories, you could add an entry to the `exclude` array, or you can use a machine user token or a fine-grained access token.
- **[Fine-grained access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token)**:<br>Allows scoping access tokens to specific repositories with specific permissions. Consult the [table below](#fine-grained-access-token-permissions) for the required permissions.
- **[Machine user token](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#machine-users)**:<br>Generates a token for a machine user that is affiliated with an organization instead of a user account.

### Personal access token scopes

No [token scopes](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes) are required if you only want to sync public repositories and don't want to use any of the following features. Otherwise, the following token scopes are required for specific features:

| Feature                                               | Required token scopes                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Sync private repositories](#private-repositories)    | `repo`                                                                                                         |
| [Sync repository permissions][permissions]            | `repo`                                                                                                         |
| [Batch changes][batch-changes]                        | `repo`, `read:org`, `user:email`, `read:discussion`, and `workflow` ([learn more][batch-changes-interactions]) |

<span class="virtual-br"></span>

> WARNING: In addition to the prerequisite token scopes, the account attached to the token must actually have the same level of access to the relevant resources that you are trying to grant. For example:
>
> - If read access to repositories is required, the token must have `repo` scope *and* the token's account must have read access to the relevant repositories. This can happen by being directly granted read access to repositories, being on a team with read access to the repository, and so on.
> - If write access to repositories is required, the token must have `repo` scope *and* the token's account must have write access to all repositories. This can happen by being added as a direct contributor, being on a team with write access to the repository, being an admin for the repository's organization, and so on.
> - If write access to organizations is required, the token must have `write:org` scope *and* the token's account must have write access for all organizations. This can happen by being an admin in all relevant organizations.
>
> Learn more about how the GitHub API is used and what level of access is required in the corresponding feature documentation.

### Fine-grained access token permissions

Fine-grained tokens can access public repositories, but can only access the private repositories of the account they are scoped to.

When creating your fine-grained access token, select the following permissions depending on the purpose of the token:

| Feature                                               | Required token permissions                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Sync private repositories](#private-repositories)    | `Repository permissions: Contents - Access: Read-only` |
| [Sync repository permissions][permissions]            | `Repository permissions: Contents - Access: Read-only` |
| [Batch changes][batch-changes]                        | `Unsupported`                                          |

<br>

> WARNING: Fine-grained tokens don't support the `repositoryQuery` code host connection option or batch changes. Both of these features rely on GitHub's GraphQL API, which is [unsupported by fine-grained access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql#authenticating-with-graphql).

### Private repositories

To clone and search private repositories, we need [a GitHub access token](#github-api-access) with the required scopes and at least read access to the relevant private repositories.

For more details, see [GitHub API access](#github-api-access).

## Selecting repositories to sync

There are four fields for configuring which repositories are mirrored/synchronized:

- [`repos`](github.md#repos)<br>A list of repositories in `owner/name` format. The order determines the order in which we sync repository metadata and is safe to change.
- [`orgs`](github.md#orgs)<br>A list of organizations (every repository belonging to the organization will be cloned).
- [`repositoryQuery`](github.md#repositoryQuery)<br>A list of strings with three pre-defined options (`public`, `affiliated`, `none`, none of which are subject to result limitations), and/or a [GitHub advanced search query](https://github.com/search/advanced). Note: There is an existing limitation that requires the latter, GitHub advanced search queries, to return [less than 1000 results](#repositoryquery-returns-first-1000-results-only). See [this issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/2562) for ongoing work to address this limitation.
- [`exclude`](github.md#exclude)<br>A list of repositories to exclude which takes precedence over the `repos`, `orgs`, and `repositoryQuery` fields.

## Rate limits

Always include a token in a configuration for a GitHub.com URL to avoid being denied service by GitHub's [unauthenticated rate limits](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28#rate-limiting). If you don't want to automatically synchronize repositories from the account associated with your personal access token, you can create a token without a [`repo` scope](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps/#available-scopes) for the purposes of bypassing rate limit restrictions only.

When Sourcegraph hits a rate limit imposed by GitHub, Sourcegraph waits the appropriate amount of time specified by GitHub before retrying the request. This can be several minutes in extreme cases.

### GitHub Enterprise Server rate limits

Rate limiting may not be enabled by default. To check and verify the current rate limit settings, you may make a request to the `/rate_limit` endpoint like this:

```
$ curl -s https://<github-enterprise-url>/api/v3/rate_limit -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
{
  "message": "Rate limiting is not enabled.",
  "documentation_url": "https://docs.github.com/enterprise/3.3/rest/reference/rate-limit#get-rate-limit-status-for-the-authenticated-user"
}
```

### Internal rate limits

See [Internal rate limits](./rate_limits.md#internal-rate-limits).

## Repository permissions

Prerequisite for configuring repository permission syncing: [Add GitHub as an authentication provider](../auth/index.md#github).

Then, add or edit the GitHub connection as described above and include the `authorization` field:

```json
{
  // ...
  "authorization": {}
}
```

This needs to be done for every github code host connection if there is more than one configured.

Repo-centric permission syncing is done by calling the [list repository collaborators GitHub API endpoint](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/collaborators/collaborators#list-repository-collaborators). To call this API endpoint correctly, we need a [GitHub access token](#github-api-access) with the required scopes and read and write access to all relevant repositories.

> IMPORTANT: We strongly recommend configuring both read and write access to associated repositories for permission syncing due to GitHub's token scope requirements. Without write access, there will be a conflict between [user-centric sync](../permissions/syncing.md#troubleshooting) and repo-centric sync. In that case, [disable repo-centric permission sync](../permissions/syncing.md#disable-repo-centric-permission-sync) (supported in <span class="badge badge-note">Sourcegraph 5.0.4+</span>).

<span class="virtual-br"></span>

> IMPORTANT: Optional, but strongly recommended - [continue with configuring webhooks for permissions](../config/webhooks/incoming.md#user-permissions).

<span class="virtual-br"></span>

> NOTE: It can take some time to complete full cycle of repository permissions sync if you have a large number of users or repositories. [See sync duration time](../permissions/syncing.md#sync-duration) for more information.

### Trigger permissions sync from GitHub webhooks

Follow the link to [configure webhooks for permissions for Github](../config/webhooks/incoming.md#user-permissions)

### Teams and organizations permissions caching

<span class="badge badge-experimental">Experimental</span>

> WARNING: The following section is experimental and might not work properly anymore on new Sourcegraph versions (post 4.0+). Please prefer [configuring webhooks for permissions instead](../config/webhooks/incoming.md#user-permissions)

Github code host can leverage caching mechanisms to reduce the number of API calls used when syncing permissions. This can significantly reduce the amount of time it takes to perform a full cycle of permissions sync due to reduced instances of being rate limited by the code host, and is useful for code hosts with very large numbers of users and repositories.

Sourcegraph can leverage caching of GitHub [team](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-team-access-to-an-organization-repository) and [organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization) permissions.

> NOTE: You should only try this if your GitHub setup makes extensive use of GitHub teams and organizations to distribute access to repositories and your number of `users * avg_repositories` is greater than 250,000 (which roughly corresponds to the scale at which [GitHub rate limits might become an issue](../permissions/syncing.md#sync-duration)).
<!-- 5,000 requests an hour * 100 items per page / 2-way sync = approx. 250,000 items before hitting a limit -->

This caching behaviour can be enabled via the `authorization.groupsCacheTTL` field:

```json
{
   "url": "https://github.example.com",
   "token": "$PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
   "authorization": {
     "groupsCacheTTL": 72, // hours
   }
}
```

In the corresponding [authorization provider](../auth/index.md#github) in [site configuration](./../config/site_config.md), the `allowGroupsPermissionsSync` field must be set as well for the correct auth scopes to be requested from users:

```json
{
  // ...
  "auth.providers": [
    {
      "type": "github",
      "url": "https://github.example.com",
      "allowGroupsPermissionsSync": true,
    }
  ]
}
```

A [token that has the required scopes](#github-api-access) and both read and write access to all relevant repositories and organizations is needed to fetch repository permissions and team memberships. 
Read-only access will *not* work with cached permissions sync, but will work with careful configuration for [regular GitHub permissions sync](#repository-permissions).

When enabling this feature, we currently recommend a default `groupsCacheTTL` of `72` (hours, or 3 days). A lower value can be set if your teams and organizations change frequently, though the chosen value must be at least several hours for the cache to be leveraged in the event of being rate-limited (which takes [an hour to recover from](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting)).

Cache invalidation happens automatically on certain webhook events, so it is recommended to configure webhook support when using cached permissions sync.
Caches can also be [manually invalidated](#manually-invalidate-caches) if necessary.

#### Manually invalidate caches

To force a bypass of caches during a sync, you can manually queue users or repositories for sync with the `invalidateCaches` options via the Sourcegraph GraphQL API:

```gql
mutation {
  scheduleUserPermissionsSync(user: "userid", options: {invalidateCaches: true}) {
    alwaysNil
  }
}
```

## User authentication

To configure GitHub as an authentication provider (which will enable sign-in via GitHub), see the
[authentication documentation](../auth/index.md#github).

## Webhooks

Using the `webhooks` property on the external service has been deprecated.

Please consult [this page](../config/webhooks/incoming.md) in order to configure webhooks.

## Configuration

GitHub connections support the following configuration options, which are specified in the JSON editor in the site admin "Manage code hosts" area.

<div markdown-func=jsonschemadoc jsonschemadoc:path="admin/external_service/github.schema.json">[View page on docs.sourcegraph.com](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/external_service/github) to see rendered content.</div>

## Default branch

Sourcegraph displays search results from the default branch of a repository when no `revision:` [parameter](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/reference/queries#repository-revisions) is specified. If you'd like the search results to be displayed from another branch by default, you may [change a repo's default branch on the github repo settings page](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/changing-the-default-branch). If this is not an option, consider using [search contexts](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_search/how-to/search_contexts) instead. 

## Troubleshooting

### Hitting GitHub Search API rate limit with repositoryQuery
When Sourcegraph syncs repositories configured  via `repositoryQuery`, it consumes GitHub API search rate limit, which is lower than the normal rate limit. The `affiliated`, `public` and `none` special values, however, trigger normal API requests instead of search API requests.

When the search rate limit quota is exhausted, an error like `failed to list GitHub repositories for search: page=..., searchString=\"...\"` can be found in logs. To work around this try reducing the frequency with which repository syncing happens by setting a higher value (in minutes) of `repoListUpdateInterval` in your Sourcegraph [site config](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/config/site_config).

`repositoryQuery` is the only repo syncing method that consumes GitHub search API quota, so if setting `repoListUpdateInterval` doesn't work consider switching your syncing method to use another option, like `orgs`, or using one of the special values described above.

### "repositoryQuery": ["public"] does not return archived status of a repo

The  `repositoryQuery` option `"public"` is valuable in that it allows sourcegraph to sync all public repositories, however, it does not return whether or not a repo is archived. This can result in archived repos appearing in normal search. You can see an example of what is returned by the GitHub API for a query to "public" [here](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#list-public-repositories).

If you would like to sync all public repositories while omitting archived repos, consider generating a GitHub token with access to only public repositories, then use `repositoryQuery` with option `affiliated` and an `exclude` argument with option `public` as seen in the example below:
```
{
    "url": "https://github.example.com",
    "gitURLType": "http",
    "repositoryPathPattern": "devs/{nameWithOwner}",
    "repositoryQuery": [
        "affiliated"
    ],
    "token": "TOKEN_WITH_PUBLIC_ACCESS",
    "exclude": [
        {
            "archived": true
        }
    ]
}
```
