# Bitbucket Cloud

Site admins can sync Git repositories hosted on [Bitbucket Cloud](https://bitbucket.org) with Sourcegraph so that users can search and navigate the repositories.

To connect Bitbucket Cloud to Sourcegraph:

1. Go to **Site admin > Manage repositories > Add repositories**
1. Select **Bitbucket.org**.
1. Configure the connection to Bitbucket Cloud using the action buttons above the text field, and additional fields can be added using <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl+Space</kbd> for auto-completion. See the [configuration documentation below](#configuration).
1. Press **Add repositories**.

## Repository syncing

Currently, all repositories belonging the user configured will be synced.

In addition, there is one more field for configuring which repositories are mirrored:

- [`teams`](bitbucket_cloud.md#configuration)<br>A list of teams that the configured user has access to whose repositories should be synced.
- [`exclude`](bitbucket_cloud.md#configuration)<br>A list of repositories to exclude which takes precedence over the `teams` field.

### HTTPS cloning

Sourcegraph clones repositories from your Bitbucket Cloud via HTTP(S), using the [`username`](bitbucket_cloud.md#configuration) and [`appPassword`](bitbucket_cloud.md#configuration) required fields you provide in the configuration.

## Internal rate limits

Internal rate limiting can be configured to limit the rate at which requests are made from Sourcegraph to Bitbucket Cloud. 

If enabled, the default rate is set at 7200 per hour (2 per second) which can be configured via the `requestsPerHour` field (see below). If rate limiting is configured more than once for the same code host instance, the most restrictive limit will be used.

**NOTE** Internal rate limiting is only currently applied when synchronising [campaign](../../user/campaigns/index.md) changesets.

## Configuration

Bitbucket Cloud connections support the following configuration options, which are specified in the JSON editor in the site admin "Manage repositories" area.
