# Bitbucket Cloud

Site admins can sync Git repositories hosted on [Bitbucket Cloud](https://bitbucket.org) with Sourcegraph so that users can search and navigate the repositories.

To connect Bitbucket Cloud to Sourcegraph:

1. Depending on whether you are a site admin or user:
    1. *Site admin*: Go to **Site admin > Manage code hosts > Add repositories**
    1. *User*: Go to **Settings > Manage hosts**.
1. Select **Bitbucket.org**.
1. Configure the connection to Bitbucket Cloud using the action buttons above the text field, and additional fields can be added using <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl+Space</kbd> for auto-completion. See the [configuration documentation below](#configuration).
1. Press **Add repositories**.

**NOTE** That adding code hosts as a user is currently in private beta.

## Repository syncing

Currently, all repositories belonging the user configured will be synced.

In addition, there is one more field for configuring which repositories are mirrored:

- [`teams`](bitbucket_cloud.md#configuration)<br>A list of teams that the configured user has access to whose repositories should be synced.
- [`exclude`](bitbucket_cloud.md#configuration)<br>A list of repositories to exclude which takes precedence over the `teams` field.

### HTTPS cloning

Sourcegraph clones repositories from your Bitbucket Cloud via HTTP(S), using the [`username`](bitbucket_cloud.md#configuration) and [`appPassword`](bitbucket_cloud.md#configuration) required fields you provide in the configuration.

## Internal rate limits

Internal rate limiting can be configured to limit the rate at which requests are made from Sourcegraph to Bitbucket Cloud. 

If enabled, the default rate is set at 7200 per hour (2 per second) which can be configured via the `requestsPerHour` field (see below):

- For Sourcegraph <=3.38, if rate limiting is configured more than once for the same code host instance, the most restrictive limit will be used.
- For Sourcegraph >=3.39, rate limiting should be enabled and configured for each individual code host connection.

**NOTE** Internal rate limiting is only currently applied when synchronising changesets in [batch changes](../../batch_changes/index.md), repository permissions and repository metadata from code hosts.

## Configuration

Bitbucket Cloud connections support the following configuration options, which are specified in the JSON editor in the site admin "Manage code hosts" area.

## Webhooks

> NOTE: Experimental webhook support for Bitbucket Cloud was added in Sourcegraph 3.40. Please <a href="https://about.sourcegraph.com/contact">contact us</a> with any issues found while using webhooks.

To set up authentication for webhooks the `webhookSecret` setting has to be set, which is then used to authenticate incoming webhook requests to `/.api/bitbucket-cloud-webhooks`.

```json
{
  "webhookSecret": "verylongrandomsecret"
}
```

Using webhooks is highly recommended when using [Batch Changes](../../batch_changes/index.md), since they speed up the syncing of pull request data between Bitbucket Cloud and Sourcegraph and make it more efficient.

To set up webhooks:

1. In Sourcegraph, go to **Site admin > Manage code hosts** and edit the Bitbucket Cloud configuration.
1. Add the `"webhookSecret"` property to the configuration (you can generate a secret with `openssl rand -hex 32`):<br /> `"webhookSecret": "verylongrandomsecret"`
1. Click **Update repositories**.
1. Copy the webhook URL displayed below the **Update repositories** button.
1. On Bitbucket Cloud, go to each repository, and then **Repository settings > Webhooks**.
1. Click **Add webhook**.
1. Fill in the webhook form:
   * **Title**: any title.
   * **URL**: the URL you copied above from Sourcegraph.
   * **Triggers**: select **Build status created** and **Build status updated** under **Repository**, and every item under **Pull request**.
1. Click **Save**.
1. Confirm that the new webhook is listed below **Repository hooks**.

Done! Sourcegraph will now receive webhook events from Bitbucket Cloud and use them to sync pull request events, used by [batch changes](../../batch_changes/index.md), faster and more efficiently.
