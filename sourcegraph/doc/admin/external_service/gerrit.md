# Gerrit

Site admins can sync Git repositories hosted on their private Gerrit instance with Sourcegraph so that users can search and navigate the repositories.

To connect Gerrit to Sourcegraph:

1. Go to **Site admin > Manage code hosts > Add code host**
2. Select **Gerrit**
3. Set **url** to the URL of your Gerrit instance.
4. Provide an admin **username** and **password**. A password can be generated by following [these](https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.14.2/user-upload.html#http) instructions. Only HTTP/HTTPS credentials are supported.
5. Click **Add repositories**.

```json
{
  "url": "https://gerrit.example.com",
  "username": "<admin username>",
  "password": "<admin password>",
  "projects": [ // If not set, all projects on the Gerrit instance will be mirrored
    "docs",
    "kubernetes/kubernetes"
  ]
}
```

## Repository permissions

By default, all Sourcegraph users can view all repositories. To configure
Sourcegraph to use Gerrit's access management, see "[Repository permissions](../repo/permissions.md#gerrit)".

## User authentication

If repository permissions is configured, Gerrit has to be added as an authentication provider.
See the [authentication documentation](../auth/index.md#gerrit).

## Configuration

Gerrit connections support the following configuration options, which are specified in the JSON editor in the site admin "Manage code hosts" area.
