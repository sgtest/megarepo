# Sourcegraph Firefox Add-on security

## Why can't I get Sourcegraph extensions in the FireFox Add-on? 

We removed extensions – except code intelligence language extensions – in order to comply with Mozilla's policy regarding [add-on development practices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/AMO/Policy/Reviews#Development_Practices). 

This issue is specifically related to how we have chosen to implement Sourcegraph extensions.

We made Sourcegraph extensions centrally managed by your Sourcegraph instance, not individually managed in your Firefox profile. Our customers are companies that roll out the browser extension to all employees, and asking each employee to individually manage Sourcegraph settings in Firefox would be more complex for both users and admins than the centrally managed solution.

## Mozilla add-on policies and the Sourcegraph extension security model

In their add-on development policies, Mozilla specifically mentions remote code execution:

> Add-ons must be self-contained and not load remote code for execution.

Sourcegraph extensions are executed from remote code, but their execution environment is restricted:

*   Sourcegraph extension JavaScript bundles are hosted on a Sourcegraph instance (either sourcegraph.com, or a self-hosted instance for Enterprise customers using the private extension registry)
*   The JavaScript bundles are fetched at runtime, and executed in a WebWorker in the add-on’s background page, using `WebWorkerGlobalScope.importScripts()`
    *   Executing in the background page ensures extensions never have access to your browsing context. They cannot manipulate the DOM, or make same-origin requests on websites you visit.
    *   The sandboxed scope of the WebWorker means Sourcegraph extensions can’t interact with the WebExtension APIs.
    *   The extension’s interactions are strictly restricted to what is defined in the [Sourcegraph extension API](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/blob/packages/sourcegraph-extension-api/src/sourcegraph.d.ts).

The above, third-party extensions being opt-in, and users always being able to inspect the bundle of Sourcegraph extensions when they enable them, makes us confident that Sourcegraph extensions do not negatively impact our users’ browsing safety.

Mozilla’s main objection to our execution model is the fact that extensions upgrade automatically without user interaction, so the add-on will always fetch the latest version of the extension from your Sourcegraph instance. In order to be compliant, we had to remove non-language extensions. 

## What can I do?

If you use Bitbucket Server, you can enable the [Bitbucket Server plugin](bitbucket_server.md#sourcegraph-bitbucket-server-plugin) to bring Sourcegraph functionality including extensions to your code host directly. Otherwise, to get Sourcegraph extensions on your code host via the browser extension, you must use either our Safari or Chrome [browser extension](browser_extension.md). 

## What are Sourcegraph extensions, and who can author them?

Sourcegraph extensions provide a way to extend the functionality of both a Sourcegraph instance and our browser add-on by writing JavaScript code against the Sourcegraph extension API. Sourcegraph uses extensions to implement some core features, for example, code intelligence extensions for different languages. Sourcegraph extensions also provide an opportunity for third-party developers to extend Sourcegraph's functionality.

In the Sourcegraph extension registry, users can always examine the JavaScript bundle of the extension, and, if provided by the author, its source repository. Extensions are always opt-in, except for trusted language extensions providing code intelligence that are written and maintained by Sourcegraph.

Sourcegraph site admins can opt to [only allow specific extensions](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/extensions#allow-only-specific-extensions-from-sourcegraph-com) from the sourcegraph.com public extension registry, or to disable extensions from the public registry altogether. Additionally, enterprise customers can opt to maintain a private extension registry to host trusted extensions privately.
