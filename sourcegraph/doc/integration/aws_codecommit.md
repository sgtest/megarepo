# AWS CodeCommit integration with Sourcegraph

Sourcegraph integrates with [AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/).

## AWS CodeCommit configuration

Sourcegraph supports syncing repositories from [AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/).

- Add AWS CodeCommit as an external service (in **Site admin > External services**, or in the site config JSON editor in Sourcegraph 2.x)

- Read the [AWS CodeCommit configuration documentation](../admin/site_config/all.md#awscodecommitconnection-object) or press Ctrl+Space or Cmd+Space in the configuration editor.

## Browser extension

The [Sourcegraph browser extension](browser_extension.md) does not yet support AWS CodeCommit.
