[Sourcegraph campaigns](../index.md) use [campaign specs](../explanations/introduction_to_campaigns.md#campaign-spec) to define campaigns.

This page is a reference guide to the campaign spec YAML format in which campaign specs are defined. If you're new to YAML and want a short introduction, see "[Learn YAML in five minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/)."

## [`name`](#name)

The name of the campaign, which is unique among all campaigns in the namespace. A campaign's name is case-preserving.

### Examples

```yaml
name: update-go-import-statements
```

```yaml
name: update-node.js
```

## [`description`](#description)

The description of the campaign. It's rendered as Markdown.

### Examples

```yaml
description: This campaign changes all `fmt.Sprintf` calls to `strconv.Iota`.
```

```yaml
description: |
  This campaign changes all imports from

  `gopkg.in/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-in-x86-asm`

  to

  `github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-in-x86-asm`
```

## [`on`](#on)

The set of repositories (and branches) to run the campaign on, specified as a list of search queries (that match repositories) and/or specific repositories.

### Examples

```yaml
on:
  - repositoriesMatchingQuery: lang:go fmt.Sprintf("%d", :[v]) patterntype:structural
  - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph
```

## [`on.repositoriesMatchingQuery`](#on-repositoriesmatchingquery)

A Sourcegraph search query that matches a set of repositories (and branches). Each matched repository branch is added to the list of repositories that the campaign will be run on.

See "[Code search](../../code_search/index.md)" for more information on Sourcegraph search queries.

### Examples

```yaml
on:
  - repositoriesMatchingQuery: file:README.md -repo:github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli
```

```yaml
on:
  - repositoriesMatchingQuery: lang:typescript file:web const changesetStatsFragment
```

## [`on.repository`](#on-repository)

A specific repository (and branch) that is added to the list of repositories that the campaign will be run on.

A `branch` attribute specifies the branch on the repository to propose changes to. If unset, the repository's default branch is used. If set, it overwrites earlier values to be used for the repository's branch.

### Examples

```yaml
on:
  - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli
```

```yaml
on:
  - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph
    branch: 3.19-beta
  - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli
```

In the following example, the `repositoriesMatchingQuery` returns both repositories with their default branch, but the `3.23` branch is used for `github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph`, since it is more specific:

```yaml
on:
  - repositoriesMatchingQuery: repo:sourcegraph\/(sourcegraph|src-cli)$
  - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph
    branch: 3.23
```

In this example, `3.19-beta` branch is used, since it was named last:

```yaml
on:
  - repositoriesMatchingQuery: repo:sourcegraph\/(sourcegraph|src-cli)$
  - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph
    branch: 3.23
  - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph
    branch: 3.19-beta
```


## [`steps`](#steps)

The sequence of commands to run (for each repository branch matched in the `on` property) to produce the campaign's changes.

### Examples

```yaml
steps:
  - run: echo "Hello World!" >> README.md
    container: alpine:3
```

```yaml
steps:
  - run: comby -in-place 'fmt.Sprintf("%d", :[v])' 'strconv.Itoa(:[v])' .go -matcher .go -exclude-dir .,vendor
    container: comby/comby
  - run: gofmt -w ./
    container: golang:1.15-alpine
```

```yaml
steps:
  - run: ./update_dependency.sh
    container: our-custom-image
    env:
      OLD_VERSION: 1.31.7
      NEW_VERSION: 1.33.0
```

## [`steps.run`](#steps-run)

The shell command to run in the container. It can also be a multi-line shell script. The working directory is the root directory of the repository checkout.

<aside class="note">
<span class="badge badge-feature">Templating</span> <code>steps.run</code> can include <a href="campaign_spec_templating">template variables</a> in Sourcegraph 3.22 and <a href="https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli">Sourcegraph CLI</a> 3.21.5.
</aside>

## [`steps.container`](#steps-run)

The Docker image used to launch the Docker container in which the shell command is run.

The image has to have either the `/bin/sh` or the `/bin/bash` shell.

It is executed using `docker` on the machine on which the [Sourcegraph CLI (`src`)](https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli) is executed. If the image exists locally, that is used. Otherwise it's pulled using `docker pull`.

## [`steps.env`](#steps-env)

Environment variables to set in the environment when running this command.

These may be defined either as an [object](#environment-object) or (in Sourcegraph 3.23 and later) as an [array](#environment-array).

<aside class="note">
<span class="badge badge-feature">Templating</span> The value for each entry in <code>steps.env</code> can include <a href="campaign_spec_templating">template variables</a> in Sourcegraph 3.22 and <a href="https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli">Sourcegraph CLI</a> 3.21.5.
</aside>

### Environment object

In this case, `steps.env` is an object, where the key is the name of the environment variable and the value is the value.

#### Examples

```yaml
steps:
  - run: echo $MESSAGE >> README.md
    container: alpine:3
    env:
      MESSAGE: Hello world!
```

### Environment array

> NOTE: This feature is only available in Sourcegraph 3.23 and later.

In this case, `steps.env` is an array. Each array item is either:

1. An object with a single property, in which case the key is used as the environment variable name and the value the value, or
2. A string that defines an environment variable to include from the environment `src` is being run within. This is useful to define secrets that you don't want to include in the spec file, but this makes the spec dependent on your environment, means that the local execution cache will be invalidated each time the environment variable changes, and means that the campaign spec file is no longer [the sole source of truth intended by the campaigns design](../explanations/campaigns_design.md).

#### Examples

This example is functionally the same as the [object](#environment-object) example above:

```yaml
steps:
  - run: echo $MESSAGE >> README.md
    container: alpine:3
    env:
      - MESSAGE: Hello world!
```

This example pulls in the `USER` environment variable and uses it to construct the line that will be appended to `README.md`:

```yaml
steps:
  - run: echo $MESSAGE from $USER >> README.md
    container: alpine:3
    env:
      - MESSAGE: Hello world!
      - USER
```

For instance, if `USER` is set to `adam`, this would append `Hello world! from adam` to `README.md`.

## [`steps.files`](#steps-files)

> NOTE: This feature is only available in Sourcegraph 3.22 and later.

Files to create on the host machine and mount into the container when running `steps.run`.

`steps.files` is an object, where the key is the name of the file _inside the container_ and the value is the content of the file.

<aside class="note">
<span class="badge badge-feature">Templating</span> The value for each entry in <code>steps.files</code> can include <a href="campaign_spec_templating">template variables</a> in Sourcegraph 3.22 and <a href="https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli">Sourcegraph CLI</a> 3.21.5.
</aside>

### Examples

```yaml
steps:
  - run: cat /tmp/my-temp-file.txt >> README.md
    container: alpine:3
    files:
      /tmp/my-temp-file.txt: Hello world!
```

```yaml
steps:
  - run: cat /tmp/global-gitignore >> .gitignore
    container: alpine:3
    files:
      /tmp/global-gitignore: |
        # Vim
        *.swp
        # JetBrains/IntelliJ
        .idea
        # Emacs
        *~
        \#*\#
        /.emacs.desktop
        /.emacs.desktop.lock
        .\#*
        .dir-locals.el
```

## [`steps.outputs`](#steps-outputs)

> NOTE: This feature is only available in Sourcegraph 3.24 and later.

Output variables that are set after the [`steps.run`](#steps-run) command has been executed. These variables are available in the global `outputs` namespace as `outputs.<name>` <a href="campaign_spec_templating">template variables</a> in the `run`, `env`, and `outputs` properties of subsequent steps, and the [`changesetTemplate`](#changesettemplate). Two steps with the same output variable name will overwrite the previous contents.

### Examples

```yaml
steps:
  - run: yarn upgrade
    container: alpine:3
    outputs:
      # Set output `friendlyMessage`
      friendlyMessage:
        value: "Hello there!"
```

```yaml
steps:
  - run: echo "Hello there!" >> message.txt && cat message.txt
    container: alpine:3
    outputs:
      friendlyMessage:
        # `value` supports templating variables and can access the just-executed
        # step's stdout/stderr.
        value: "${{ step.stdout }}"
```

```yaml
steps:
  - run: echo "Hello there!"
    container: alpine:3
    outputs:
      stepOneOutput:
        value: "${{ step.stdout }}"
  - run: echo "We have access to the output here: ${{ outputs.stepOneOutput }}"
    container: alpine:3
    outputs:
      stepTwoOutput:
        value: "here too: ${{ outputs.stepOneOutput }}"
```

```yaml
steps:
  - run: cat .goreleaser.yml >&2
    container: alpine:3
    outputs:
      goreleaserConfig:
        value: "${{ step.stderr }}"
        # Specifying a `format` tells Sourcegraph CLI how to parse the value before
        # making it available as a template variable.
        format: yaml

changesetTemplate:
  # [...]
  body: |
    The `goreleaser.yml` defines the following `before.hooks`:
    ${{ outputs.goreleaserConfig.before.hooks }}
```

## [`steps.outputs.<name>.value`](#steps-outputs-name-value)

The value the output should be set to.

<aside class="note">
<span class="badge badge-feature">Templating</span> <code>steps.outputs.$name.value</code> can include <a href="campaign_spec_templating">template variables</a>.
</aside>

## [`steps.outputs.<name>.format`](#steps-outputs-name-format)

The format of the corresponding [`steps.outputs.<name>.value`](#outputs-value). When this is set to something other than `text`, it will be parsed as the given format.

Possible values: `text`, `yaml`, `json`. Default is `text`.

## [`importChangesets`](#importchangesets)

An array describing which already-existing changesets should be imported from the code host into the campaign.

### Examples

```yaml
importChangesets:
  - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph
    externalIDs: [13323, "13343", 13342, 13380]
  - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli
    externalIDs: [260, 271]
```


## [`importChangesets.repository`](#importchangesets-repository)

The repository name as configured on your Sourcegraph instance.

## [`importChangesets.externalIDs`](#importchangesets-externalids)

The changesets to import from the code host. For GitHub this is the pull request number, for GitLab this is the merge request number, for Bitbucket Server this is the pull request number.

## [`changesetTemplate`](#changesettemplate)

A template describing how to create (and update) changesets with the file changes produced by the command steps.

This defines what the changesets on the code hosts (pull requests on GitHub, merge requests on Gitlab, ...) will look like.

### Examples

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
  title: Replace equivalent fmt.Sprintf calls with strconv.Itoa
  body: This campaign replaces `fmt.Sprintf("%d", integer)` calls with semantically equivalent `strconv.Itoa` calls
  branch: campaigns/sprintf-to-itoa
  commit:
    message: Replacing fmt.Sprintf with strconv.Iota
    author:
      name: Lisa Coder
      email: lisa@example.com
  published: false
```

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
  title: Update rxjs in package.json to newest version
  body: This pull request updates rxjs to the newest version, `6.6.2`.
  branch: campaigns/update-rxjs
  commit:
    message: Update rxjs to 6.6.2
  published: true
```

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
  title: Run go fmt over all Go files
  body: Regular `go fmt` run over all our Go files.
  branch: go-fmt
  commit:
    message: Run go fmt
    author:
      name: Anna Wizard
      email: anna@example.com
  published:
    # Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.
    - git.istari.example/*: false
    - git.istari.example/anna/*: true
```

## [`changesetTemplate.title`](#changesettemplate-title)

The title of the changeset on the code host.

<aside class="note">
<span class="badge badge-feature">Templating</span> <code>changesetTemplate.title</code> can include <a href="campaign_spec_templating">template variables</a> starting with Sourcegraph 3.24 and <a href="../../cli">Sourcegraph CLI</a> 3.24.
</aside>

## [`changesetTemplate.body`](#changesettemplate-body)

The body (description) of the changeset on the code host. If the code supports Markdown you can use it here.

<aside class="note">
<span class="badge badge-feature">Templating</span> <code>changesetTemplate.body</code> can include <a href="campaign_spec_templating">template variables</a> starting with Sourcegraph 3.24 and <a href="../../cli">Sourcegraph CLI</a> 3.24.
</aside>

## [`changesetTemplate.branch`](#changesettemplate-branch)

The name of the Git branch to create or update on each repository with the changes.

<aside class="note">
<span class="badge badge-feature">Templating</span> <code>changesetTemplate.branch</code> can include <a href="campaign_spec_templating">template variables</a> starting with Sourcegraph 3.24 and <a href="../../cli">Sourcegraph CLI</a> 3.24.
</aside>

## [`changesetTemplate.commit`](#changesettemplate-commit)

The Git commit to create with the changes.

## [`changesetTemplate.commit.message`](#changesettemplate-commit-message)

The Git commit message.

<aside class="note">
<span class="badge badge-feature">Templating</span> <code>changesetTemplate.commit.message</code> can include <a href="campaign_spec_templating">template variables</a> starting with Sourcegraph 3.24 and <a href="../../cli">Sourcegraph CLI</a> 3.24.
</aside>

## [`changesetTemplate.commit.author`](#changesettemplate-commit-author)

The `name` and `email` of the Git commit author.

<aside class="note">
<span class="badge badge-feature">Templating</span> <code>changesetTemplate.commit.author</code> can include <a href="campaign_spec_templating">template variables</a> starting with Sourcegraph 3.24 and <a href="../../cli">Sourcegraph CLI</a> 3.24.
</aside>

### Examples

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
  commit:
    author:
      name: Alan Turing
      email: alan.turing@example.com
```

## [`changesetTemplate.published`](#changesettemplate-published)

Whether to publish the changeset. This may be a boolean value (ie `true` or `false`), `'draft'`, or [an array to only publish some changesets within the campaign](#publishing-only-specific-changesets).

An unpublished changeset can be previewed on Sourcegraph by any person who can view the campaign, but its commit, branch, and pull request aren't created on the code host.

When `published` is set to `draft` a commit, branch, and pull request / merge request are being created on the code host **in draft mode**. This means:

- On GitHub the changeset will be a [draft pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests).
- On GitLab the changeset will be a merge request whose title is be prefixed with `'WIP: '` to [flag it as a draft merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/work_in_progress_merge_requests.html#adding-the-draft-flag-to-a-merge-request).
- On BitBucket Server draft pull requests are not supported and changesets published as `draft` won't be created.

> NOTE: Changesets that have already been published on a code host as a non-draft (`published: true`) cannot be converted into drafts. Changesets can only go from unpublished to draft to published, but not from published to draft. That also allows you to take it out of draft mode on your code host, without risking Sourcegraph to revert to draft mode.

A published changeset results in a commit, branch, and pull request being created on the code host.

### [Publishing only specific changesets](#publishing-only-specific-changesets)

To publish only specific changesets within a campaign, an array of single-element objects can be provided. For example:

```yaml
published:
  - github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph: true
  - github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli: false
  - github.com/sourcegraph/campaignutils: draft
```

Each key will be matched against the repository name using [glob](https://godoc.org/github.com/gobwas/glob#Compile) syntax. The [gobwas/glob library](https://godoc.org/github.com/gobwas/glob#Compile) is used for matching, with the key operators being:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `*`  | Match any sequence of characters |
| `?`  | Match any single character |
| `[ab]` | Match either `a` or `b` |
| `[a-z]` | Match any character between `a` and `z`, inclusive |
| `{abc,def}` | Match either `abc` or `def` |

If multiple entries match a repository, then the last entry will be used. For example, `github.com/a/b` will _not_ be published given this configuration:

```yaml
published:
  - github.com/a/*: true
  - github.com/*: false
```

If no entries match, then the repository will not be published. To make the default true, add a wildcard entry as the first item in the array:

```yaml
published:
  - "*": true
  - github.com/*: false
```

> NOTE: The standalone `"*"` is quoted in the key to avoid ambiguity in the YAML document.

By adding a `@<branch>` at the end of a match-rule, the rule is only matched against changesets with that branch:

```yaml
published:
  - github.com/sourcegraph/src-*@my-branch: true
  - github.com/sourcegraph/src-*@my-other-branch: true
```

### Examples

To publish all changesets created by a campaign:

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
  published: true
```

To publish all changesets created by a campaign as drafts:

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
  published: draft
```

To only publish changesets within the `sourcegraph` GitHub organization:

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
  published:
    - github.com/sourcegraph/*: true
```

To publish all changesets that are not on GitLab:

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
  published:
    - "*": true
    - gitlab.com/*: false
```

To publish all changesets on GitHub as draft:

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
  published:
    - "*": true
    - github.com/*: draft
```

To publish only one of many changesets in a repository by addressing them with their branch name:

```yaml
changesetTemplate:
  published:
    - "*": true
    - github.com/sourcegraph/*@my-branch-name-1: draft
    - github.com/sourcegraph/*@my-branch-name-2: false
```

(Multiple changesets in a single repository can be produced, for example, [per project in a monorepo](../how-tos/creating_changesets_per_project_in_monorepos.md) or by [transforming large changes into multiple changesets](../how-tos/creating_multiple_changesets_in_large_repositories.md)).

## [`transformChanges`](#transformchanges)

<aside class="experimental">
<span class="badge badge-experimental">Experimental</span> <code>transformChanges</code> is an experimental feature in Sourcegraph 3.23 and <a href="https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli">Sourcegraph CLI</a> 3.23. It's a <b>preview</b> of functionality we're currently exploring to make managing large changes in large repositories easier. If you have any feedback, please let us know!
</aside>

A description of how to transform the changes (diffs) produced in each repository before turning them into separate changeset specs by inserting them into the [`changesetTemplate`](#changesettemplate).

This allows the creation of multiple changeset specs (and thus changesets) in a single repository.

### Examples

```yaml
# Transform the changes produced in each repository.
transformChanges:
  # Group the file diffs by directory and produce an additional changeset per group.
  group:
    # Create a separate changeset for all changes in the top-level `go` directory
    - directory: go
      branch: my-campaign-go # will replace the `branch` in the `changesetTemplate`

    - directory: internal/codeintel
      branch: my-campaign-codeintel # will replace the `branch` in the `changesetTemplate`
      repository: github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli # optional: only apply the rule in this repository
```


```yaml
transformChanges:
  group:
    - directory: go/utils/time
      branch: my-campaign-go-time

    # The *last* matching directory is used, not the most specific one,
    # so only this changeset would be opened.
    - directory: go/utils
      branch: my-campaign-go-date
```

## [`transformChanges.group`](#transformchanges-group)

A list of groups to define which file diffs to group together to create an additional changeset in the given repository.

The **order of the list matters**, since each file diff's filepath is matched against the `directory` of a group and the **last match** is used.

If no changes have been produced in a `directory` then no changeset will be created.

## [`transformChanges.group.directory`](#transformchanges-group-directory)

The name of the directory in which file diffs should be grouped together.

The name is relative to the root of the repository.

## [`transformChanges.group.branch`](#transformchanges-group-branch)

The branch that should be used for this additional changeset. This **overwrites the [`changesetTemplate.branch`](#changesettemplate-branch)** when creating the additional changeset.

**Important**: the branch can _not_ be nested under the [`changesetTemplate.branch`](#changesettemplate-branch), i.e. if the `changesetTemplate.branch` is `my-campaign` then this can _not_ be `my-campaign/my-subdirectory` since [git doesn't allow that](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22630664).

## [`transformChanges.group.repository`](#transformchanges-repository)

Optional: the file diffs matching the given directory will only be grouped in a repository with that name, as configured on your Sourcegraph instance.

## [`workspaces`](#workspaces)

<aside class="experimental">
<span class="badge badge-experimental">Experimental</span> <code>workspaces</code> is an experimental feature in Sourcegraph 3.25 and <a href="https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli">Sourcegraph CLI</a> 3.25. It's a <b>preview</b> of functionality we're currently exploring to make managing large changes in large repositories easier. If you have any feedback, please let us know!
</aside>

The optional `workspaces` property allows users to define where projects are located in repositories and cause the [`steps`](#steps) to be executed for each project, instead of once per repository. That allows easier creation of multiple changesets in large repositories.

For each repository that's yielded by [`on`](#on) and matched by a [`workspaces.in`](#workspaces-in) property, Sourcegraph search is used to get the locations of the `rootAtLocationOf` file. Each location then serves as a workspace for the execution of the `steps`, instead of the root of the repository.

**Important**: Since multiple workspaces in the same repository can produce multiple changesets, it's **required** to use templating to produce a unique [`changesetTemplate.branch`](#changesettemplate-branch) for each produced changeset. See the [examples](#workspaces-examples) below.

### [Examples](#workspaces-examples)

Defining JavaScript projects that live in a monorepo by using the location of the `package.json` file as the root for each project:

```yaml
on:
  - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph

workspaces:
  - rootAtLocationOf: package.json
    in: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph

changesetTemplate:
  # [...]

  # Since a changeset is uniquely identified by its repository and its
  # branch we need to ensure that each changesets has a unique branch name.

  # We can use templating and helper functions get the `path` in which
  # the `steps` executed and turn that into a branch name:
  branch: my-multi-workspace-campaign-${{ replace steps.path "/" "-" }}
```

Using templating to produce a unique branch name in repositories _with_ workspaces and repositories without workspaces:

```yaml
on:
  - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph
  - repository: github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli

workspaces:
  - rootAtLocationOf: package.json
    in: github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph

changesetTemplate:
  # [...]

  # Since the steps in `github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli` are executed in the
  # root, where path is "", we can use `join_if` to drop it from the branch name
  # if it's a blank string:
  branch: ${{ join_if "-" "my-multi-workspace-campaign" (replace steps.path "/" "-") }}
```

Defining where Go, JavaScript, and Rust projects live in multiple repositories:

```yaml
workspaces:
  - rootAtLocationOf: go.mod
    in: github.com/sourcegraph/go-*
  - rootAtLocationOf: package.json
    in: github.com/sourcegraph/*-js
    onlyFetchWorkspace: true
  - rootAtLocationOf: Cargo.toml
    in: github.com/rusty-org/*

changesetTemplate:
  # [...]

  branch: ${{ join_if "-" "my-multi-workspace-campaign" (replace steps.path "/" "-") }}
```

Using [`steps.outputs`](#steps-outputs) to dynamically create unique branch names:

```yaml
# [...]
on:
  # Find all repositories with a package.json file
  - repositoriesMatchingQuery: repohasfile:package.json

workspaces:
  # Define that workspaces have their root folder at the location of the
  # package.json files
  - rootAtLocationOf: package.json
    in: "*"

steps:
  # [... steps that produce changes ...]

  # Run `jq` to extract the "name" from the package.json
  - run:  jq -j .name package.json
    container: jiapantw/jq-alpine:latest
    outputs:
      # Set outputs.packageName to stdout of this step's `run` command.
      packageName:
        value: ${{ step.stdout }}

changesetTemplate:
  # [...]

  # Use `outputs` variables to create a unique branch name per changeset:
  branch: my-campaign-${{ outputs.projectName }}

## [`workspaces.rootAtLocationOf`](#workspaces-rootatlocationof)

The full name of the file that sits at the root of one or more workspaces in a given repository.

Sourcegraph code search is used to find the location of files with this name in the repositories returned by [`on`](#on).

For example, in a repository with the following files:

- `packages/sourcegraph-ui/package.json`
- `packages/sourcegraph-test-helper/package.json`

the workspace configuration

```yaml
workspaces:
  - rootAtLocationOf: package.json
    in: "*"
```

would create _two changesets_ in the repository, one in `packages/sourcegraph-ui` and one in `packages/sourcegraph-test-helper`.

## [`workspaces.in`](#workspaces-in)

The repositories in which the workspace should be discovered.

This field supports **globbing** by using [glob](https://godoc.org/github.com/gobwas/glob#Compile) syntax. See "[Publishing only specific changesets](#publishing-only-specific-changesets)" for more information on globbing.

A repository matching multiple entries results in an error.

### Examples

Match all repository names that begin with `github.com/`:

```yaml
workspaces:
  - rootAtLocationOf: go.mod
    in: github.com/*
```

Match all repository names that begin with `gitlab.com/my-javascript-org/` and end with `-plugin`:

```yaml
workspaces:
  - rootAtLocationOf: package.json
    in: gitlab.com/my-javascript-org/*-plugin
```

## [`workspaces.onlyFetchWorkspace`](#workspaces-onlyfetchworkspace)

When set to `true`, only the folder containing the workspace is downloaded to execute the `steps`.

This field is not required and when not set the default is `false`.

Additional files — `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` as of now — are downloaded from the location of the workspace up to the root of the repository.

For example, with the following file layout in a repository

```
.
├── a
│   ├── b
│   │   ├── [... other files in b ...]
│   │   ├── package.json
│   │   └── .gitignore
│   │
│   ├── [... other files in a ...]
│   ├── .gitattributes
│   └── .gitignore
│
├── [... other files in root ... ]
└── .gitignore
```

and this workspace configuration

```yaml
workspaces:
  - rootAtLocationOf: package.json
    in: github.com/our-our/our-large-monorepo
    fetchOnlyWorkspace: true
```

then

- the `steps` will be executed in `b`
- the complete contents of `b` will be downloaded and are available to the steps
- the `.gitattributes` and `.gitignore` files in `a` will be downloaded and put in `a`, **but only those**
- the `.gitignore` files in the root will be downloaded and put in the root folder, **but only that file**

### Examples

Only download the workspaces of specific JavaScript projects in a large monorepo:

```yaml
workspaces:
  - rootAtLocationOf: package.json
    in: github.com/our-our/our-large-monorepo
    fetchOnlyWorkspace: true
```
