# Closing or deleting a campaign

You can close a campaign when you don't need it anymore, when all changes have been merged, or when you decide not to proceed with making changes. A closed campaign still appears in the [campaigns list](viewing_campaigns.md). To completely remove it, you can delete the campaign.

Any person with [admin access to the campaign](../explanations/permissions_in_campaigns.md#permission-levels-for-campaigns) can close or delete it.

1. Click the <img src="../campaigns-icon.svg" alt="Campaigns icon" /> campaigns icon in the top navigation bar.
1. In the list of campaigns, click the campaign that you'd like to close or delete.
1. In the top right, click the **Close** button.
1. Select whether you want to close all of the campaign's open changesets (e.g., closing all associated GitHub pull requests on the code host).
1. Click **Close campaign**.
