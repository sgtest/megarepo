# Site admin configuration for campaigns

Using campaigns requires a [code host connection](../../../admin/external_service/index.md) to a supported code host (currently GitHub, Bitbucket Server, and GitLab).

Site admins can also:

- [Configure repository permissions](../../../admin/repo/permissions.md), which campaigns will respect.
- [Disable campaigns](../explanations/permissions_in_campaigns.md#disabling-campaigns).
- [Disable campaigns for non-site-admin users](../explanations/permissions_in_campaigns.md#disabling-campaigns-for-non-site-admin-users).
