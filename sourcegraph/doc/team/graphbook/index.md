# Graphbook

The Graphbook is the Sourcegraph handbook, the reference manual for Sourcegraph team members.

- [Travel budgets](travel.md)
- [Weekly team meeting](team_meeting.md)

> NOTE: We're in the process of making most of it public. In the meantime, Sourcegraph team members can access it in the [Graphbook private repository](https://sourcegraph.sgdev.org/github.com/sourcegraph/Graphbook).
