# Searching across your organization’s code on Sourcegraph Cloud

> WARNING: [Private code on Sourcegraph.com is no longer supported](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/single-tenant-cloud) and all previously synced code will be removed on August 1.

After adding your organization’s repositories to sync with Sourcegraph Cloud, all members of your organization can immediately start searching across your organization’s code.

To search across only your organization’s repositories, use your organization’s search context, **context:@organization-name**, which automatically includes all repositories your organization has added to Sourcegraph Cloud.

Your organization’s search context is only available to members of your organization.

You can switch between your organization’s search context and the global search context at any time. Learn more about using [search contexts](../../code_search/how-to/searching_with_search_contexts.md).
