# Debugging in server-side Batch Changes

## Using server-side Batch Changes to dive deep into the execution

With server-side Batch Changes, you can monitor various artifacts of an execution, like per-step logs, timing information and output variables in a persisted, sharable UI.

From the UI, you can start from a high level perspective for the entire batch spec and then drill down to find the problem.

Start by going to the workspace that failed. Then, you get an overview of all the steps that ran and the one that failed.
From there on, you can dive into logs, previous steps outputs and more.
