# LSIF Typed protocol reference


### Document

Document defines the metadata about a source file on disk.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **relative_path** | string | (Required) Path to the text document relative to the directory supplied in the associated `Metadata.project_root`. Not URI-encoded. This value should not begin with a directory separator.
| repeated **occurrences** | Occurrence | Occurrences that appear in this file.
| repeated **symbols** | SymbolInformation | Symbols that are defined within this document.



### Index

Index represents a complete LSIF index for a workspace this is rooted at a
single directory. An Index message payload can have a large memory footprint
and it's therefore recommended to emit and consume an Index payload one field
value at a time.  To permit streaming consumption of an Index payload, the
`metadata` field must appear at the start of the stream and must only appear
once in the stream. Other field values may appear in any order.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **metadata** | Metadata | Metadata about this index.
| repeated **document** | Document | Documents that belong to this index.
| repeated **external_symbols** | SymbolInformation | Symbols that are referenced from this index and not defined in this index.



### Metadata



| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **version** | ProtocolVersion | Which version of this protocol was used to generate this index?
|  **tool_info** | ToolInfo | Information about the tool that produced this index.
|  **project_root** | string | URI-encoded absolute path to the root directory of this index. All documents in this index must appear in a subdirectory of this root directory.
|  **text_document_encoding** | TextEncoding | Text encoding of the source files on disk that are referenced from `Document.relative_path`.




### Occurrence

Occurrence associates a source position with a symbol and/or highlighting
information.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| repeated **range** | int32 | Source position of this occurrence. Must be exactly three or four elements:
|  **symbol_uri** | string | (optional) References the `Symbol.uri` field. Can be empty if this is only a highlighting occurrence.
|  **symbol_roles** | int32 | (optional) Is the symbol_uri defined or referenced at this occurrence?
| repeated **override_documentation** | string | (optional) Markdown-formatted documentation for this specific range.  If empty, the `Symbol.documentation` field is used instead. One example where this field might be useful is when the symbol represents a generic function (with abstract type parameters such as `List<T>`) and at this occurrence we know the exact values (such as `List<String>`).
|  **syntax_kind** | SyntaxKind | (optional) What syntax highlighting class should be used for this range?

Additional notes on **range**:

Source position of this occurrence. Must be exactly three or four
elements:

- Four elements: `[startLine, startCharacter, endLine, endCharacter]`
- Three elements: `[startLine, startCharacter, endCharacter]`. The end line
  is inferred to have the same value as the start line.

Line numbers and characters are always 0-based. Make sure to increment the
line/character values before displaying them in an editor-like UI because
editors conventionally use 1-based numbers.

Historical note: the original draft of this schema had a `Range` message
type with `start` and `end` fields of type `Position`, mirroring LSP.
Benchmarks revealed that this encoding was inefficient and that we could
reduce the total payload size of an index by 50% by using `repeated int32`
instead.  The `repeated int32` encoding is admittedly more embarrassing to
work with in some programming languages but we hope the performance
improvements make up for it.





### SymbolInformation

SymbolInformation defines metadata about a symbol, such as the symbol's
docstring or what package it's defined it.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **symbol** | string | The unique dentifier of this symbol, which can be referenced from `Occurence.symbol`.
| repeated **documentation** | string | (optional, but strongly recommended) The markdown-formatted documentation for this symbol. This field is repeated to allow different kinds of documentation.  For example, it's nice to include both the signature of a method (parameters and return type) along with the accompanying docstring.
|  **package** | string | (optional) To enable cross-index navigation, specify which package this symbol is defined in. A package must be encoded as a space-separated string with the value `"$manager $name $version"` where: - `$manager` is the name of the package manager, for example `npm`. - `$name` is the name of the package, for example `react`. - `$version` is the version of the package, for example `1.2.0`.
| repeated **reference_symbols** | string | (optional) When resolving "Find references", this field documents what other symbols should be included together with this symbol. For example, consider the following TypeScript code that defines two symbols `Animal#sound()` and `Dog#sound()`: ```ts interface Animal {           ^^^^^^ definition Animal#   sound(): string   ^^^^^ definition Animal#sound() } class Dog implements Animal {       ^^^ definition Dog#, implementation_symbols = Animal#   public sound(): string { return "woof" }          ^^^^^ definition Dog#sound(), references_symbols = Animal#sound(), implementation_symbols = Animal#sound() } const animal: Animal = new Dog()               ^^^^^^ reference Animal# console.log(animal.sound())                    ^^^^^ reference Animal#sound() ``` Doing "Find references" on the symbol `Animal#sound()` should return references to the `Dog#sound()` method as well. Vice-versa, doing "Find references" on the `Dog#sound()` method should include references to the `Animal#sound()` method as well.
| repeated **implementation_symbols** | string | (optional) Similar to `references_symbols` but for "Go to implementation". It's common for the `implementation_symbols` and `references_symbols` fields have the same values but that's not always the case. In the TypeScript example above, observe that `implementation_symbols` has the value `"Animal#"` for the "Dog#" symbol while `references_symbols` is empty. When requesting "Find references" on the "Animal#" symbol we don't want to include references to "Dog#" even if "Go to implementation" on the "Animal#" symbol should navigate to the "Dog#" symbol.
| repeated **type_definition_symbols** | string | (optional) Similar to `references_symbols` but for "Go to type definition".






### ToolInfo



| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **name** | string | Name of the indexer that produced this index.
|  **version** | string | Version of the indexer that produced this index.
| repeated **arguments** | string | Command-line arguments that were used to invoke this indexer.
