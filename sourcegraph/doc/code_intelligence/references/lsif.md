# LSIF Typed protocol reference


### Document

Document defines information about a particular source file.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **relative_path** | string | Relative path to the `Index.project_root` directory.
| repeated **occurrences** | Occurrence | Symbol occurrences that appear in this file.
| repeated **symbols** | Symbol | Symbols that are defined within this document.



### Index

Index represents an LSIF index. An index can be consumed in a streaming
fashion by consuming one value at a time. In Java, use `parseDelimetedFrom`
to consume the index in a streaming fashion. For other languages like Go, you
need to write custom logic that decodes one LSIF `Value` at a time.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **metadata** | Metadata | Metadata about this index.
| repeated **document** | Document | Documents that belong to this index or the packages that are defined by this index.
| repeated **package** | Package | Packages that are either referenced from this index or the packages that are defined by this index.
| repeated **external_symbols** | Symbol | Symbols that are defined outside of this index but are referenced from inside this index.




### Metadata



| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **tool_info** | ToolInfo | 
|  **project_root** | string | URI-encoded absolute path to the root directory of this index. All documents in this index must appear in a subdirectory of this root directory.
|  **position_encoding** | PositionEncoding | 



#### PositionEncoding



| Number | Name | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| 0 | POSITION_ENCODING_UNSPECIFIED | 
| 1 | POSITION_ENCODING_UTF8 | 
| 2 | POSITION_ENCODING_UTF16 | 
### Occurrence

Occurrence associates a source position with a symbol and/or highlighting
information.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| repeated **range** | int32 | The source position of this occurrence. Must be exactly three or four elements:
|  **symbol_uri** | string | (optional) References the `Symbol.uri` field. Can be empty if this is only a highlighting occurrence.
|  **symbol_role** | Role | (optional) Is the symbol_uri defined or referenced at this occurrence?
| repeated **symbol_documentation** | string | (optional) Markdown-formatted documentation for this specific range.  If empty, the `Symbol.documentation` field is used instead. One example where this field might be useful is when the symbol represents a generic function (with abstract type parameters such as `List<T>`) and at this occurrence we know the exact values (such as `List<String>`).
|  **highlight** | Highlight | (optional) What syntax highlighting class should be used for this range?

Additional notes on **range**:

The source position of this occurrence. Must be exactly three or four
elements:

- Four elements: `[startLine, startCharacter, endLine, endCharacter]`
- Three elements: `[startLine, startCharacter, endCharacter] (endLine ==
startLine)`

Line numbers and characters are always 0-based. Make sure to increment the
line/character values before displaying them in an editor-like UI because
editors conventionally use 1-based numbers.

Ranges appear frequently in real-world LSIF payloads, the `repeated int32`
encoding was chosen over the LSP `Range(start:Position,end:Position)`
encoding for performance reasons.  Benchmarks reveal that this change alone
reduces the total payload size by ~2x in both compressed JSON or Protobuf
encoding. This encoding is admittedly more embarrassing to work with in
some programming languages but we hope the increased performance
improvements make up for it.





#### Highlight



| Number | Name | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| 0 | HIGHLIGHT_UNSPECIFIED | 
| 1 | HIGHLIGHT_STRING_LITERAL | 
| 2 | HIGHLIGHT_NUMERIC_LITERAL | 
| 3 | HIGHLIGHT_IDENTIFIER | 
| 4 | HIGHLIGHT_METHOD_IDENTIFIER | 
| 5 | HIGHLIGHT_TYPE_IDENTIFIER | 
| 6 | HIGHLIGHT_TERM_IDENTIFIER | 
| 7 | HIGHLIGHT_LOCAL_IDENTIFIER | 
| 8 | HIGHLIGHT_SHADED_IDENTIFIER | 
| 9 | HIGHLIGHT_PACKAGE_IDENTIFIER | 
#### Role



| Number | Name | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| 0 | ROLE_UNSPECIFIED | 
| 1 | ROLE_DEFINITION | 
| 2 | ROLE_REFERENCE | 
### Package

Package defines a publishable artifact such as an npm package, Docker
container, JVM dependency, or a Cargo crate.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **uri** | string | The unique identifier of this package that can be referenced from `Symbol.package_uri`.  This URI is not intended to be displayed to humans, but it's recommended to use a human-readable format to aid with debugging.
|  **name** | string | Name of this package, for example "@types/react" or "com.google.guava:guava".
|  **version** | string | Version of this package, for example "0.1.0" or "2.1.5".
|  **manager** | string | Package manager, for example "npm", "maven" or "cargo".




### Symbol

Symbol defines a symbol, such as a function or an interface.

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
|  **uri** | string | The identifier of this symbol, which can be referenced from Occurence. An empty uri means this symbol can be ignored.
|  **unique** | Unique | Determines whether this symbol is local to a single document or if can be referenced from multiple documents. Document symbols (`Document.symbols`) can be either local or global. External symbols (`Index.external_symbols`) must be global.
| repeated **documentation** | string | (optional, but strongly recommended) The markdown-formatted documentation for this symbol. This field is repeated to allow different kinds of documentation.  For example, it's nice to include both the signature of a method (parameters and return type) along with the accompanying docstring.
|  **package_uri** | string | (optional) Links to the original package that defines this symbol to enable navigation across different LSIF indexes (whether they come from different projects or git repositories). This field must be non-empty for toplevel symbols (`Value.value`).
| repeated **reference_symbols** | string | (optional) Symbols that should be included together with this symbol when resolving "find references".  For example, the symbol of a TypeScript or Java method that implements an interface method should list the interface method here.
| repeated **implementation_symbols** | string | (optional) Symbols that are "implemented" by this symbol. For example, the symbol of a TypeScript or Java class that implements an interface should list the interface here.






#### Unique



| Number | Name | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| 0 | UNIQUE_UNSPECIFIED | 
| 1 | UNIQUE_DOCUMENT | 
| 2 | UNIQUE_GLOBAL |
