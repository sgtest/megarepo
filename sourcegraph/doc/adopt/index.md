# Adopting Sourcegraph

- Why should my company use Sourcegraph?
  - [Sourcegraph user features](../getting-started/index.md)
  - [Why code search is still needed for monorepos](code_search_in_monorepos.md)
- [How to run a Sourcegraph trial](trial/index.md)
  1. [Define success](trial/index.md#1-define-trial-success)
  1. [Deploy Sourcegraph](trial/index.md#2-deploy-sourcegraph)
  1. [Share with a wide trial team](trial/index.md#3-share-with-the-trial-team) (25â€“500 developers, one full organization or team, to start)
  1. [Deploy integrations](trial/index.md#4-deploy-integrations)
  1. [Measure success](trial/index.md#5-measure-success) (i.e., track usage, survey the team, etc.)
