# Retrospectives

We value continuous learning and improvement.

Retrospectives are a chance for teams to reflect on past experiences, celebrate what went well, and identify areas of improvement for the future.

Significant projects and releases are great learning opportunities and should always have retrospectives. Anyone involved in a project or release can lead a retrospective.

## How to lead a retrospective

If you want to lead a retrospective for a project or release, follow these steps.

### Collect feedback

Identify everyone who should participate in the retrospective: this is the retrospective group. This should include everyone who participated in the project or release.

Collect written answers to the following questions from everyone in the retrospective group.

> What should we start doing?
>
> What should we stop doing?
>
> What should we continue doing?

The medium through which you collect answers to these questions is not important (e.g. Google Docs, Google Forms, Slack messages).

Allocate enough time for teammates to thoughtfully respond to the survey (aim for 100% participation), but don't let the process take an unbounded amount of time. It is useful to complete the retrospective process expediently so that information is fresh in people's minds and so we can apply learnings sooner. 3 business days is a good default.

### Organize the feedback

Assemble all of the raw feedback into a single document and group related items together by theme.

Share this document with the retrospective group and ask each participant to:
- Provide feedback on whether the feedback items were grouped effectively (e.g. it is possible that you misunderstood some raw feedback)
- +1 the most important themes. Each individual should not +1 more than half of the themes.

### Discuss the feedback

Schedule a meeting to discuss the results.

The meeting should be time-bounded (e.g. 1 hour), so there might not be time to discuss everything. Sort the themes by +1s and make a jugement about which themes to discuss and how much time to allocate to each discussion.

For each theme, ask someone to read (out loud) the theme followed by the raw feedback. Then have an open discussion about the theme and how we should move forward.

Update the retrospective document with notes from the discussion, action items, and owners for those actions.

### Publish the results

Remove any sensitive information from the retrospective document and commit it to this directory.
