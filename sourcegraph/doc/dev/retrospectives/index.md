# Retrospectives

Retrospectives are an important part of our product-engineering process. They help us continuously improve Sourcegraph as a company, team, and product.

Significant projects and releases should all have retrospectives. Anyone involved in a project or release can lead a retrospective.

## Current and past retrospectives

Add links to completed retrospective docs here. These are publicly visible, so make sure they don't include anything sensitive.

Format for active retrospectives:
- $PROJECT retrospective: [survey]($SURVEY_LINK) ($LEADER)

Format for past retrospectives:
- [$PROJECT retrospective]($DOC_LINK) ($LEADER)

- Sourcegraph 3.0 beta retrospective: [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSceowJsPCfow-7cwSiQk4xpQkwu_az6sQ2xIWbSLGEbnLePMQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) (@sqs)

## How to lead a retrospective

If you want to lead a retrospective for a project or release, follow these steps.

### Set up the survey and meeting

Start at least 3 days before you intend to hold the retrospective meeting.

To begin, create the retrospective survey and schedule the meeting:

1. Tell the other people involved that you will be leading the retrospective (to avoid having multiple lead duplicate retrospectives).
1. Create a survey for the retrospective:
   1. Open the [Retrospective TEMPLATE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gt9UMYmYKmsAH--UE2SWh-aixwmQXLvGfJOHRt6oZ9w/edit).
   1. Click **â‹® > Make a copy**
   1. Name and title it "$PROJECT retrospective".
   1. Update the intro text as needed.
   1. Click **SEND** and then click the link icon to copy the survey link (hereafter $SURVEY_LINK).
1. Create a calendar event for the retrospective meeting.

    Be sure to choose a time (hereafter $MEETING_TIME) at least 48 hours from now so people have time to fill out the survey and you have time to compile the results. Also, be sure to choose a time that is likely to work for everyone, which usually means in the European afternoon or Caliornia morning.

    > Event title: $PROJECT retrospective
    >
    > Event description: To participate, please submit the retrospective survey at $SURVEY_LINK. Everyone who submits the survey will get an invite to this calendar event.
1. Announce the retrospective in #dev-announce (or directly to the people involved, for smaller projects). Usually $SURVEY_DEADLINE is 24 hours before $MEETING_TIME.

    > To participate in the $PROJECT retrospective, please fill out this survey by $SURVEY_DEADLINE: $SURVEY_LINK.

Next, monitor survey responses until the deadline:

- Add survey submitters to the calendar event.
- Send a personal message to each desired participant if they haven't yet submitted the survey:

    > Please fill out the $PROJECT retrospective survey by $SURVEY_DEADLINE if you want to get your points in: $SURVEY_LINK.
- If needed, ask participants for clarification or details on their survey submission.
