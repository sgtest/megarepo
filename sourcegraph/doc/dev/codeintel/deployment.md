# Deploying code intelligence services

Code intelligence services currently deploy with the rest of Sourcegraph. However, once [RFC 199: User code execution in the auto-indexer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rCduWqaLAbMu2s43RwJTBbRlhL6qS3oqq4iawiGdoVE) has been implemented, we will have Cloud-only auto-indexer service that must be deployed out-of-band (outside of Kubernetes). Documentation about this process will reside here once that effort has completed.
