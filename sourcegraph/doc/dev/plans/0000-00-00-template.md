# [Title]

[A very brief explanation of this plan.]

## Background

[A description of the problem that this plan addresses along with any other relevant context.]

## Plan

[A precise statement of the planned work.]

### Test plan

[A description of how the planned work will be tested in an automated way.]

### Release plan

[A description of how the planned work will be released to users (e.g. feature flags, automatic data migrations, etc.).]

### Success metrics

[The metrics that will be used to measure the success of this plan.]

### Company goals

[An explanation of how this plan advances one of the current [company goals](company-goals.md).]

## Rationale

[A discussion of alternate approaches and the trade offs, advantages, disadvantages, risks, and uncertainties of the specified approach.]

## Checklist 

[An ordered checklist that enumerates what needs to be done in as much detail as possible, and estimates for how much time each task will take.]

## Done date

[The date that all goals of the project will be accomplished. This is a firm commitment that we can communicate to anyone (e.g. internal team, external customers). As such, the date should account for all factors that could impact the it (including, but not limited to, necessary refactoring, testing, fixing bugs discovered, etc.), discounting by probability. Once approved, this date cannot be changed without agreement from the project approvers. If a project is ever at risk of not hitting the planned date, the project owner should immediately bring this to the attention of the approvers and also do whatever work is necessary to bring the project back on schedule. Descoping is generally preferred to moving the date. If the date needs to be moved, it is better to move it early in the project's lifecycle, so prioritize work that gives you more information about the remaining work first.]

## Retrospective

[This section is completed after the project is completely done (i.e. the checklist is complete).]

### Actual checklist

[The checklist that was actually completed (i.e. paste the final checklist from the issue). Explain any differences from the original checklist in the plan.]

### Actual done date

[The date that the project was actually finished. Explain why this is earlier or later than originally planned or explain why the project was not completed.]
