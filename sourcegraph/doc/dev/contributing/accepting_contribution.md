# How to accept an external contribution

This page outlines how to accept a contribution to the [Sourcegraph repository](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph).

## CLA-bot

1. For external contributors only: ensure that that contributor signed the [CLA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_iBZh9PJi-05vTnlQ3GVeeRe8H3Wq1_FZ49aYrsHGLQ/edit?usp=sharing). All fields should be filled with valid data to proceed with the pull request. (This does not apply for Sourcegraph teammates.)
2. Update the CLA-bot configuration [here](https://github.com/sourcegraph/clabot-config/edit/main/.clabot) by adding a contributor name to the `contributors` field, preserving the alphabetical order.
3. Comment on the pull request: `@cla-bot check`.
4. The `verification/cla-signed` workflow should become green. ðŸŽ‰

## Buildkite

To request a [Buildkite build](../background-information/ci/index.md#buildkite-pipelines) for a pull request from a fork, a build must be manually requested after reviewing the contributor's changes. A successful Buildkite build is required for a pull request to be merged.

> WARNING: Builds do not happen automatically for forks for security reasons - Buildkite build runs have access to a variety of secrets used in testing. When reviewing, ensure that there are no unexpected usages of secrets or attempts to expose secrets in logs or external services.

### Request a build directly

Once changes have been reviewed, a build can be requested directly for a commit with [the `sg` CLI](../background-information/sg/index.md):

```sh
sg ci build --commit $COMMIT
```

### Check out and request a build

To check out a pull request's code locally, use [the `gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com/):

```sh
gh pr checkout $NUMBER
```

Alternatively, it is also possible to check out the branch without having to re-clone the forked repo by running the following - make sure that the created branch name exactly matches their branch name, otherwise Buildkite will not match the created build to their branch:

```sh
git fetch git@github.com:$THEIR_USERNAME/sourcegraph $THEIR_BRANCH:$THEIR_BRANCH
```

Then, use [the `sg` CLI](../background-information/sg/index.md) to request a build after reviewing the code:

```sh
sg ci build
```
