Telemetry describes the logging of user events, such as a page view or search. Telemetry data is collected by each Sourcegraph instance and is not sent to Sourcegraph.com (except in aggregate form as documented in "[Pings](../../admin/pings.md)"). Some select managed instances enable
event level (non-aggregated) [telemetry](./data-usage-pipeline.md).

## Browser extension telemetry

> Note: this section relates only to browser extension and not native integration telemetry

#### Action telemetry (a.k.a User event logs)

Browser extension telemetry data is sent only to the connected Sourcegraph instance URL (except in aggregate form as documented in "[Pings](../../admin/pings.md)"). 

- In Chrome and Safari telemetry is always enabled
- In Firefox telemetry is enabled if
  - connected to self-hosted Sourcegraph URL
  - or `Send telemetry` is checked on options page

**All browser extension events are triggered with:**
- `source`: constant `CODEHOSTINTEGRATION`
- `anonymizedUserId`: generated user ID, stored in browser local storage
- `sourcegraphURL`: connected/configured Sourcegraph URL
- `platform`: detected platform name (one of `chrome-extension` | `safari-extension` | `firefox-extension`)

**Following event logs are triggered from the browser extension:**
- `BrowserExtensionInstalled`: triggered on initial install
- `hover`: when successfully showing non-empty/non-error hover information
- `action.id`: Sourcegraph extension action ID
  - when clicking any action from the command palette
  - or when clicking from the code view toolbar (e.g., "open in vs code")

  - > NOTE: Sourcegraph extensions don't have access to telemetry service/logging API when running in the browser extension

#### UTM markers

UTM markers are used to add markers to links generated by a browser extension.

Currently following UTM markers are generated by browser extension:

- `/search?utm_source={platform-name}&utm_campaign=global-search`: Github enhanced search feature (item in search dropdown)
- `/search?utm_source={platform-name}&utm_campaign=omnibox`: Browser omnibox (a.k.a 'src'). > Note: omnibox is supported in Chrome and Firefox
- `/sign-in?close=true&utm_source={platform-name}`: SignIn button instead of ViewOnSourcegraph when connected to self-hosted instance.
- `?utm_source={platform-name}`: "View File In Sourcegraph" button in file editor toolbar
- `?utm_source={platform-name}`: "View Diff In Sourcegraph" button in file editor toolbar
- `?utm_source={platform-name}`: "View Repo In Sourcegraph" button on the top
- `?utm_source={platform-name}&utm_campaign=hover`: All external links from hover overlay
- `?utm_source={platform-name}&utm_campaign=browser-extension-uninstall&utm_content={extension-version}`: When redirecting to about.sourcegraph.com/uninstall on browser extension uninstall


#### Error logging

We use **Sentry** to automatically log any errors in background/content scripts if `Allow Error Reporting` is enabled.
