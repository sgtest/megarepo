[`sg`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/tree/main/dev/sg) is the CLI tool that Sourcegraph developers can use to develop Sourcegraph.
Learn more about the tool's overall vision in [`sg` Vision](./vision.md), and how to use it in the [usage section](#usage).

> NOTE: Have feedback or ideas? Feel free to [open a discussion](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/discussions/categories/developer-experience)! Sourcegraph teammates can also leave a message in [#dev-experience](https://sourcegraph.slack.com/archives/C01N83PS4TU).

## Quickstart

1. Run the following to download and install `sg`:

   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSLf https://install.sg.dev | sh
   ```

2. In your clone of [`sourcegraph/sourcegraph`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph), start the default Sourcegraph environment:

   ```sh
   sg start
   ```

3. Once the `enterprise-web` process has finished compilation, open [`https://sourcegraph.test:3443`](https://sourcegraph.test:3443/) in your browser.

A more detailed introduction is available in the [development quickstart guide](../../setup/quickstart.md).

## Installation

### Using pre-built binaries (recommended)

Run the following command in a terminal:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSLf https://install.sg.dev | sh
```

That will download the latest release of `sg` from [here](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sg/releases), put it in a temporary location and run `sg install` to install it to a permanent location in your `$PATH`.

### Using install script

> NOTE: **This method requires that Go has already been installed according to the [development quickstart guide](../../setup/quickstart.md).**

Run the following in the root of `sourcegraph/sourcegraph`:

```sh
./dev/sg/install.sh
```

That builds the `sg` binary and moves it to the standard installation location for Go binaries.

If you don't have a `$GOPATH` set (or don't know what that is), that location is `$HOME/go/bin`. If you do use `$GOPATH` the location is `$GOPATH/bin`.

Make sure that location is in your `$PATH`. (If you use `$GOPATH` then `$GOPATH/bin` needs to be in the `$PATH`)

> NOTE: **For Linux users:** A command called [sg](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sg.1.html) is already available at `/usr/bin/sg`. To use the Sourcegraph `sg` CLI, you need to make sure that its location comes first in `PATH`. For example, by prepending `$GOPATH/bin`:
>
> `export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH`
>
> Instead of the more conventional:
>
> `export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin`
>
> Or you may add an alias to your `.bashrc`:
>
> `alias sg=$HOME/go/bin/sg`

### Manually building the binary

If you want full control over where the `sg` binary ends up, use this option.

In the root of `sourcegraph/sourcegraph`, run:

```sh
go build -o ~/my/path/sg ./dev/sg
```

Then make sure that `~/my/path` is in your `$PATH`.

## Usage

See [configuration](#configuration) to learn more about configuring `sg` behaviour.

```

## Configuration

Default `sg` behaviour is configured through the [`sg.config.yaml` file in the root of the `sourcegraph/sourcegraph` repository](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/main/sg.config.yaml). Take a look at that file to see which commands are run in which environment, how these commands set setup, what environment variables they use, and more.

**To modify your configuration locally, you can overwrite chunks of configuration by creating a `sg.config.overwrite.yaml` file in the root of the repository.** It's `.gitignore`d so you won't accidentally commit those changes.

If an `sg.config.overwrite.yaml` file exists, its contents will be merged with the content of `sg.config.yaml`, overwriting where there are conflicts. This is useful for running custom command sets or adding environment variables
specific to your work.

You can run `sg run debug-env` to see the environment variables passed `sg`'s child processes.

### Configuration examples

#### Changing database configuration

In order to change the default database configuration, the username and the database, for example, create an `sg.config.overwrite.yaml` file that looks like this:

```yaml
env:
  PGUSER: 'mrnugget'
  PGDATABASE: 'my-database'
```

That works for all the other `env` variables in `sg.config.yaml` too.

#### Defining a custom environment by setting a `commandset`

You can customize what boots up in your development environment by defining a `commandSet` in your `sg.config.overwrite.yaml`.

For example, the following defines a commandset called `minimal-batches` that boots up a minimal environment to work on Batch Changes:

```yaml
commandsets:
  minimal-batches:
    checks:
      - docker
      - redis
      - postgres
    commands:
      - enterprise-frontend
      - enterprise-worker
      - enterprise-repo-updater
      - enterprise-web
      - gitserver
      - searcher
      - symbols
      - caddy
      - github-proxy
      - zoekt-indexserver-0
      - zoekt-indexserver-1
      - zoekt-webserver-0
      - zoekt-webserver-1
      - batches-executor-firecracker
```

With that in `sg.config.overwrite.yaml` you can now run `sg start minimal-batches`.

### Attach a debugger

To attach the [Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) debugger, pass the environment variable `DELVE=true` into `sg`. [Read more here](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/how-to/debug_live_code#debug-go-code)

### Offline development

Sometimes you will want to develop Sourcegraph but it just so happens you will be on a plane or a
train or perhaps a beach, and you will have no WiFi. And you may raise your fist toward heaven and
say something like, "Why, we can put a man on the moon, so why can't we develop high-quality code
search without an Internet connection?" But lower your hand back to your keyboard and fret no
further, you *can* develop Sourcegraph with no connectivity by setting the
`OFFLINE` environment variable:

```bash
OFFLINE=true sg start
```

## Contributing to `sg`

Want to hack on `sg`? Great! Here's how:

1. Read through the [`sg` Vision](./vision.md) to get an idea of what `sg` should be in the long term.
2. Explore the [`sg` source code](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/-/tree/dev/sg).
3. Look at the open [`sg` issues](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Asg).

When you want to hack on `sg` it's best to be in the `dev/sg` directory and run it from there:

```sh
cd dev/sg
go run . -config ../../sg.config.yaml start
```

The `-config` can be anything you want, of course.

> NOTE: For Sourcegraph teammates, we have a weekly [`sg` hack hour](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/product-engineering/engineering/enablement/dev-experience#sg-hack-hour) you can hop in to if you're interested in contributing!

### Development tips

- Due to [#29222](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/29222), you might need to set `CONFIGURATION_MODE: 'empty'` if you encounter errors where `sg` tries to connect to `frontend`.
