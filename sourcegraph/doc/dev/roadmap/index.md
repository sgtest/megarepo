# Sourcegraph roadmap

<aside class="note visible-product"><p>View the <strong><a href="https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/roadmap">latest roadmap on docs.sourcegraph.com</a></strong>.</p></aside>

We want Sourcegraph to be the best way to answer questions while writing, reviewing, or planning code. This roadmap shows what's planned for upcoming Sourcegraph releases. See the [Sourcegraph master plan](https://about.sourcegraph.com/plan) for our high-level product vision.

A new Sourcegraph release ships in the first week of each month. The plans and timeframes are subject to change.

We welcome suggestions! Share feedback by using [code discussions](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/discuss-code-and-docs-in-repositories) on this document or the linked documents and issues.

## Themes

We want Sourcegraph to be the best way to answer questions while writing, reviewing, or planning code. See the [Sourcegraph master plan](https://about.sourcegraph.com/plan) for our high-level product vision.

Our work generally falls into the following categories:

- **Search and browsing:** quickly showing you the code you're looking for and making it easy to navigate around
- **Code intelligence:** go-to-definition, hover tooltips, references, symbols, etc., for code in many languages, including real-time and cross-repository support
- **Integrations:** making Sourcegraph work well with code hosts, review tools, editors, and other tools in your dev workflow (e.g., repository syncing from your code host, browser extensions, and editor extensions)
- **Extensibility:** supporting Sourcegraph extensions that add code intelligence and other information (e.g., tracing, logging, and security annotations from 3rd-party tools) to Sourcegraph and external tools that Sourcegraph integrates with
- **Deployment:** making it easy to run and maintain a self-hosted Sourcegraph instance
- **Enterprise:** features that larger companies need (e.g., scaling, authentication, authorization, auditing, etc.)
