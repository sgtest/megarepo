# Workarounds for M1 Mac local development

## Puppeteer
If you hit a Puppeteer error stating "The chromium binary is not available for arm64", you need to install Chromium for Puppeteer via Homebrew.
   ```
   brew install --no-quarantine chromium
   ```

   Check that Chromium opens correctly:
   ```
   open -a /Applications/Chromium.app
   ```

   If you hit an error above, try allowing the app under System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General Tab > Allow Anyways. If it was successful, exit Chromium and point Puppeteer to Chromium by adding the following to your shell configuration (e.g. `~/.zshenv`)
   ```
   export PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true
   export PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=`which chromium`
   ```
   and updating your shell (e.g. `source ~/.zshenv`).

## Rosetta
Run `softwareupdate --install-rosetta`.

## Jaeger
Get the Mac version of Jaeger https://www.jaegertracing.io/download/, extract it, then 

```
cp ~/Downloads/jaeger-1.28.0-darwin-amd64/jaeger-all-in-one ~/sourcegraph/.bin/jaeger-all-in-one-1.18.1-darwin-arm64
``` 

(adjust `~/sourcegraph` to point to you local clone of `github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph`).
