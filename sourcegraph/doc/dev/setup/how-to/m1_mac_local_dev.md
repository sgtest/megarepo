# Workarounds for M1 Mac local development

## Rosetta

Docker [requires Rosetta](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/apple-silicon/#system-requirements) to run `amd64` binaries. It should be installed by default, but if that wasn't the case, run `softwareupdate --install-rosetta`.

## Puppeteer
If you hit a Puppeteer error stating "The chromium binary is not available for arm64", you need to install Chromium for Puppeteer via Homebrew.

```
brew install --no-quarantine chromium
```

Check that Chromium opens correctly:
```
open -a /Applications/Chromium.app
```

If you hit an error above, try allowing the app under System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General Tab > Allow Anyways. If it was successful, exit Chromium and point Puppeteer to Chromium by adding the following to your shell configuration (e.g. `~/.zshenv`)
```
export PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true
export PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=`which chromium`
```

and updating your shell (e.g. `source ~/.zshenv`).

## Jaeger

[Get the Mac version of Jaeger](https://github.com/jhchabran/jaeger/releases/download/v1.28.1/jaeger-1.28.1-darwin-arm64.tar.gz), extract it, then

```
cd ~/Downloads
curl https://github.com/jhchabran/jaeger/releases/download/v1.28.1/jaeger-1.28.1-darwin-arm64.tar.gz -L | tar -xz
cp ~/Downloads/jaeger-1.28.1-darwin-arm64/jaeger-all-in-one ~/code/sourcegraph/.bin/jaeger-all-in-one-1.18.1-darwin-arm64
```

(adjust `~/code/sourcegraph` to point to you local clone of `github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph`).
