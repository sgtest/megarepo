# Living document

This is a living document, with a changelog as follows:

* Aug 13th, 2021: [@slimsag](https://github.com/slimsag) does an in-depth analysis & review of our CSRF threat model and creates this document.
* Nov 8th, 2021: [@slimsag](https://github.com/slimsag) audited all potential instances of pre-fetched content embedded into pages and found we have none, the following is NOT true ([#27236](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/27236)):
  * "Some Sourcegraph pages pre-fetch content: on the backend, data is pre-fetched for the user so that they need not make a request for the data corresponding to the page immediately upon loading it. Instead, we fetch it and embed it into the `GET` page response, giving JavaScript access to it immediately upon page load."

# Prerequisites

## Scope

Our CSRF threat model begins and ends at the `sourcegraph-frontend` layer. This is the service in which all HTTP requests reaching Sourcegraph, be they a user's web browser, or via our API, ultimately go through.

This does not cover additional load balancers, proxies, CDNs, etc. that one may put in front of Sourcegraph:

* Some of our customers choose to place Sourcegraph behind nginx or apache, which may offer additional layers of security.
* For Sourcegraph.com we place Sourcegraph behind Cloudflare and it's WAF, for additional security, rate limiting, etc.
* For managed instances, we place Sourcegraph behind Google GCP's Cloud Load Balancer and Cloud Armor. [details here](https://github.com/sourcegraph/security-issues/issues/158#issuecomment-867038398)

## What is CSRF, why is it dangerous?

See also: [OWASP: CSRF](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf)

CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) is when a legitimate user is browsing another site, say either attacker.com (ran by a malicious actor), or google.com (a legitimate site, perhaps running code by a malicious actor) makes requests to your own site, say sourcegraph.com, and is able to perform actions on behalf of the user that they did not intend to, using their own authentication credentials - often unbeknownst to them.

This can happen in *many* forms:

* GET, POST, etc. HTTP requests made via JavaScript
* GET HTTP requests made by `<img>` tags requesting images
* POST HTTP requests made via HTML `<form>` submissions.
* ...

For example, say a Sourcegraph user clicks a malicious link and Sourcegraph is not protected against CSRF. This would mean that, for example, a `<form>` element could be silently submitted in the background to perform destructive actions on behalf of the user using Sourcegraph's API - such as deleting data on Sourcegraph.

## How is CSRF mitigated traditionally?

There are multiple ways in which CSRF is protected against in the modern web, including:

* [Using custom request headers](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#use-of-custom-request-headers), relying on browser's [Same Origin Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy) restriction which says that only JavaScript can be used to add a custom header, and only within its origin by default. Browsers do not allow JavaScript to make cross origin requests with custom headers by default. This depends on CORS being properly configured and managed.
* Limiting authentication methods, for example not allowing cookie-based authentication at all, such that even if a cross-site request is possible, implicit authentication is not.
* [Use of CSRF tokens in AJAX requests](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#javascript-guidance-for-auto-inclusion-of-csrf-tokens-as-an-ajax-request-header), and in form submission parameters.

There are more mitigation techniques, and risks, that you should be aware of. See [OWASP: CSRF prevention cheat sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)

# Sourcegraph's CSRF threat model

## Request delineation: API and non-API endpoints

In Sourcegraph, we delineate between two types of requests that reach the frontend (generally the only place HTTP requests make their way into Sourcegraph):

* Those under `/.api`
  * This is _restricted_ to POST requests only.
  * This includes all GraphQL requests.
* Those _not_ under `/.api`
  * This is includes GET requests.
  * This excludes all GraphQL requests.

Having a clear separation between Sourcegraph's endpoints between API and non-API endpoints makes it easy for us to reason about the security model of each in relative isolation. It also allows us to ensure all security middleware for each endpoint uniformly applies to _all_ of our API endpoints, or all of our non-API endpoints, with ease and eliminates the need for per-endpoint security analysis.

## Where requests come from

The delineation of API and non-API endpoints is very important because we can always assume endpoints _not_ under `/.api` are being made by browsers or web crawlers: no other client would make these requests reasonably. Our API endpoints, however, can be requested by a vast myriad of clients:

* The Sourcegraph browser extension, which browsers provide a distinct ORIGIN for (separate from the domain they are executing on.)
* The `src` CLI, running on dev laptops, in CI pipelines, on servers, etc.
* Users via `curl` or various programming languages.
* Code host integrations, e.g. the Sourcegraph plugin running server-side on a Bitbucket server instance - or GitLab's integration.
* Other websites, such as e.g. github1s.com using our GraphQL API to power various features.
* Editor extensions (potentially in the future, not today)
* The Sourcegraph application itself (however, most often this goes through `/.internal` which is unauthenticated and never exposed publicly.)

## Non-API endpoints

### Non-API endpoints are generally static, unprivileged content only

Aside from the folloowing exclusions, non-API endpoints only serve static, unprivileged content only. However, the two exclusions to this are very notable:

#### Exclusion: window.context

`window.context` is served with each request. For example, if you make a request via `curl https://sourcegraph.com/search` you'll find each GET request for a page introduces context to JavaScript. Sometimes this contains unprivileged content, such as if you are not authenticated, while other times if you provide the relevant session cookie this may contain privileged content. For example, an unprivileged request looks like:

```
	<script ignore-csp>
		window.context = {"externalURL":"https://sourcegraph.com","xhrHeaders":{"X-Csrf-Token":"fKle7JmU0wfA1ol7+1sIKftRL8qklk4YqpNX5kwdAXAzg+xEGl1d7yiOR2B+PjCM9uJAZKGgV3nrN6bLt2HPuw==","X-Requested-With":"Sourcegraph","x-sourcegraph-client":"https://sourcegraph.com"},"csrfToken":"fKle7JmU0wfA1ol7+1sIKftRL8qklk4YqpNX5kwdAXAzg+xEGl1d7yiOR2B+PjCM9uJAZKGgV3nrN6bLt2HPuw==","userAgentIsBot":false,"assetsRoot":"/.assets","version":"105021_2021-08-13_2c6eb84","isAuthenticatedUser":false,"sentryDSN":"https://ae2f74442b154faf90b5ff0f7cd1c618@sentry.io/1391511","siteID":"SourcegraphWeb","siteGQLID":"U2l0ZToic2l0ZSI=","debug":false,"needsSiteInit":false,"emailEnabled":true,"site":{"auth.public":true,"authz.enforceForSiteAdmins":true,"update.channel":"release"},"likelyDockerOnMac":false,"needServerRestart":false,"deployType":"kubernetes","sourcegraphDotComMode":true,"billingPublishableKey":"pk_live_1LPIDxv3bZH5wTv9NRcu9Sik","accessTokensAllow":"all-users-create","allowSignup":true,"resetPasswordEnabled":true,"externalServicesUserMode":"public","authProviders":[{"isBuiltin":true,"displayName":"Builtin username-password authentication","serviceType":"builtin","authenticationURL":""},{"isBuiltin":false,"displayName":"GitHub","serviceType":"github","authenticationURL":"/.auth/github/login?pc=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2F%3A%3Ae917b2b7fa9040e1edd4"},{"isBuiltin":false,"displayName":"GitLab","serviceType":"gitlab","authenticationURL":"/.auth/gitlab/login?pc=https%3A%2F%2Fgitlab.com%2F%3A%3A51686001d882eae9c23bbc3d976ca07ba52c5b14fd099230a1463ac9c37f2b8b"}],"branding":{"brandName":"Sourcegraph"},"batchChangesEnabled":false,"codeIntelAutoIndexingEnabled":true,"productResearchPageEnabled":true,"experimentalFeatures":{"andOrQuery":"enabled","jvmPackages":"enabled","ranking":{"maxReorderQueueSize":16},"rateLimitAnonymous":500,"search.index.branches":{"github.com/go-yaml/yaml":["v2","v3"],"github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes":["release-1.17"],"github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph":["3.17","v3.0.0"]},"searchMultipleRevisionsPerRepository":true}}
		window.pageError =  null 
	</script>
```

The context provided has various uses:

* It contains context that is merely needed to render the page, e.g. options which are enabled on the site such as which logo image to render (customizable), etc.
* It contains context that is more critical, such as which exact CSRF tokens to include when making requests, or XHR headers to use when making requests.

Importantly, this context may contain information which is specific to the user's current authentication. That is, if you are authenticated as e.g. an site admin or user, it may contain sensitive information - even though it is merely a GET request.

TODO(slimsag): TODO(security): It is my belief JSContext should _NOT_ contain sensitive information. This makes caching of GET requests tricky and very risky, this is a dangerous weak spot in our threat model and we should correct it ASAP.

#### Exclusion: username/password manipulation (sign in, password reset, etc.)

The following are distinct non-API routes, registered under non-API endpoints. They inherit the middleware for handling authentication based on session cookies, and utilize the same CSRF protection as other non-API endpoints:

* Sign up
* Site initialization (admin account creation)
* Sign in
* Sign out
* Reset password
* Reset password code entry
* Verify email
* Checking if username is taken

They are [registered here in code](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@aefef0dab971608196310402c051f77b4b2e3c22/-/blob/cmd/frontend/internal/app/app.go?L57-65).

### Risk of CSRF attacks against our non-API endpoints

The primary risk of a forged request making its way to a non-API endpoint in Sourcegraph is that the attacker could steal the potentially sensitive data embedded in `window.context`:

1. The `window.context.xhrHeaders`, which contain a `X-Csrf-Token` header.
2. The `window.context.csrfToken` field, which contains the same CSRF token.
3. Any other potentially-sensitive information we embed in `window` described in the two exclusions above.
4. Authentication cookie access, which is used to authenticate API endpoint requests (more on this below.)

Because these non-API endpoints _never_ allow API-like access (there are no traditional REST-like APIs here, there are no create/delete/modify actions these endpoints can perform), there is _no risk_ in a CSRF attack aside from the `window.context` content and the potential for using the session cookie (which is mitigated through other means, see below.) - however this is NOT true for the two exclusions listed above (`Exclusion: window.context`, and `Exclusion: username/password manipulation (sign in, password reset, etc.)`.) It is therefor paramount that we defend against CSRF on the routes described by these exclusions. See "How we protect against CSRF in non-API endpoints" below.

With all of this in mind, it is worth calling out that:

* IF we had _no_ protection at all against CSRF on these routes (no CSRF tokens/cookies and a CORS response header of `*`)
* IF embedded `window` content was not a risk (it absolutely is today)
* THEN we would not be at risk of CSRF attacks at all, because even if `<form>`, `<img>`, and JavaScript on foreign pages could make requests to Sourcegraph's HTTP API:
  * The API routes are protected (they forbid cookie-based authentication unless a custom `X-Requested-With: Sourcegraph` header is present, more on this below.)
  * The non-API routes would be dumb, content-serving routes only. There is no create/delete/modify action. It effectively would be dumb, static-content web serving endpoints only.
  * HOWEVER, we **would** be subject to CSRF attacks in the aforementioned "[Exclusion: username/password manipulation (sign in, password reset, etc.)](#exclusion-usernamepassword-manipulation-sign-in-password-reset-etc)" routes above.

### How we protect against CSRF in non-API endpoints

There are two ways in which we prevent against CSRF in our non-API endpoints:

1. Browser's CORS policies
   1. We only allow trusted domains in our CORS handling policy.
   2. Site admins can configure trusted CORS domains via the site configuration's [`corsOrigin`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24+file:%5Eschema/site%5C.schema%5C.json+corsOrigin&patternType=literal) setting.
   3. This is our **primary** means of protecting against CSRF. It applies both to the static-content-serving routes, as well as to the username/password manipulation endpoints described above.
2. CSRF tokens
   1. The first GET request to Sourcegraph returns a CSRF token via `window.context.csrfToken`, and ALL subsequent requests to _non-API endpoints_ require the subsequent CSRF token. This is 100% a secondary, cautionary means of protection: we do not actually need these, they can be removed.
   2. Our CSRF tokens have in the past been **a major source of security issues**: sometimes, they have gotten falsely rejected due to corruption. This leads to all users being unable to authenticate with `CSRF: token invalid` errors. Site admins, and us, have attempted to fix this in the past by wiping out Redis data which stored (still today? unsure) the CSRF tokens. If done incorrectly, e.g. while Sourcegraph allows sign-ups, user IDs in the Redis DB's authentication cookies and Postgres DB could become mismatched resulting in incorrect authentication.
   3. It is @slimsag's recommendation we remove our CSRF tokens and rely solely on browser CORS policies for simplicity to avoid this type of issue (and others not mentioned here.) If you are reading this and are reporting that we do not have CSRF tokens as a vulnerability, this is why: it's not safer, it's more complexity and riskier.

## API endpoints

### All mutable and privileged actions go through Sourcegraph's API endpoints

All mutable and privileged actions go through Sourcegraph's `/.api` endpoints:

* Want to view potentially privileged search results? That is through our GraphQL `/.api/graphql` endpoint or (future) `/.api` search streaming endpoint.
* Want to create, delete, or modify anything? That is through our `/.api` endpoints.

The only mutable, privileged actions that do not go through Sourcegraph's `/.api` endpoints are the aforementioned "[Exclusion: username/password manipulation (sign in, password reset, etc.)](#exclusion-usernamepassword-manipulation-sign-in-password-reset-etc)" routes above.

### Authentication in API endpoints

Sourcegraph's API endpoints offer multiple forms of authentication for different use-cases:

1. Session cookies, via the [`session.CookieMiddlewareWithCSRFSafety`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24%40aefef0d+CookieMiddlewareWithCSRFSafety%28&patternType=literal) middleware. This allows session cookie authentication iff one of the following is true AND the request is not [a "simple" CORS request](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#cross-origin-request-with-preflight-0) (`Content-Type` header is `application/json`, or the `X-Requested-With` header is present, implying that a CORS preflight check must have preceded the request successfully):
   1. The request originates from the same origin.
   2. OR the request is cross-origin, but passed the CORS preflight check (it is an allowed origin according to the site config `corsOrigins` setting)
2. Authentication tokens, created in the Sourcegraph UI (also via the API) - checked through the [`AccessTokenAuthMiddleware`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24%40aefef0d+AccessTokenAuthMiddleware%28&patternType=literal) and specified by either:
   1. The basic auth `username` field.
   2. The `Authorization` header, in either `Authorization: token <token>` or `Authorization: token-sudo ...` form with a user to impersonate in the header value somewhere.

The above forms of authentication are allowed iff the request first is able to make its way through the [API authentication middleware](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24%40aefef0d+content:%22API:+func%28%22&patternType=literal), which ensures that instances protected by e.g. OIDC or other forms of SSO are considered. Often, for example, allowing the request to go through without using the SSO provider iff the request has an access token present. Otherwise requiring the SSO provider sign off on the request, effectively.

### How browsers authenticate with the API endpoints

Session cookies. Upon page load, users are given the session cookie and the [`session.CookieMiddlewareWithCSRFSafety`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph%24%40aefef0d+CookieMiddlewareWithCSRFSafety%28&patternType=literal) middleware allows the request because:

1. It is either from the Sourcegraph origin itself.
2. OR it comes from the Sourcegraph browser extension origin (which is a unique origin ID hash given to browser extensions by Chrome/Firefox)
3. OR it is an allowed origin in the `corsOrigin` site configuration, it is a non-simple CORS request made with `X-Requested-With: <anything>`

In some cases, e.g. in _Sourcegraph extensions_ (such as the Go code intelligence extension), the Sourcegraph extension will use the Sourcegraph API to generate an API access token and make requests by specifying that token in the `Authorization` header of its requests. This happens both on Sourcegraph.com and from code hosts, as Sourcegraph extensions run both on our website and in our browser extension on other allowed websites.

### How we protect against CSRF in API endpoints

There are a few ways in which Sourcegraph's API endpoints protect against CSRF:

1. First and foremost, by restricting session cookie-based authentication. As described above, session cookie authentication is prohibited in non-simple CORS requests which means cookies CANNOT be used to authenticate a Sourcegraph API request unless it comes from an allowed origin, passing the browser's CORS policy checks. This is the primary means by which we protect against CSRF in our API endpoints.
2. Secondarily, by providing an `Authorization` header or basic auth with an access token. This is not possible for an attacker to provide through indirect means; they would have had to convince the user to provide them with an access token.

### Known issue

CSRF protection in our API endpoints is too aggressive, leading us and customers to do more risky behavior than should be required. This is a weak point in our security model that we plan to address.

Because of point #1 above (we allow session based authentication iff the request passed CORS policy checks), it is not possible for anyone currently to use the Sourcegraph API endpoints from other, non-explicitly-allowed domains. For example:

* We cannot use the Sourcegraph search API from about.sourcegraph.com
* People cannot use the Sourcegraph.com GraphQL API from their own websites, even in authenticated form (i.e. public resolvers only)
* Customers cannot use the Sourcegraph API from their private instance on their own internal tool websites - even by having users provide an access token. The request would be forbidden as it would not pass the CORS preflight request.

The only workaround for this currently is to add the "trusted" domain to the `corsOrigin` site configuration setting. Doing so is vastly more privilege to give a domain than is often desired:

* If the desire is only to grant the domain token-based authentication to the API, it does not do that. It grants session-based auth.
* If the desire is to grant only API access, it does not do that either. It also grants the ability to perform CSRF against other non-API endpoints, such as password reset endpoints.

In general, people want to make API requests from other domains - and that is NOT the same as adding an allowed `corsOrigin` which is a much broader level of trust of a domain than just allowing API requests.

## Improving our CSRF threat model

I [@slimsag](https://github.com/slimsag) advise we make the following key improvements to our CSRF threat model in order to improve security, product reliability, and reduce risky behavior of both developers at Sourcegraph and customers on their own private instances:

### Audit usages of `window.context` to exclude any sensitive information

This may be completed at ANY time. It has NO pre-requisites.

Performing this would allow us to restrict `window.context` to ONLY public content, which would alleviate a number of tricky questions around how caching Sourcegraph GET requests can sometimes be harmful. This may already be the case today, but we'd need to verify before adjusting our model to say this is true.

See also: [Exclusion: window.context](#exclusion-windowcontext)

### Eliminate the username/password manipulation exclusion

This may be completed at ANY time. It has NO pre-requisites.

If you read "[Exclusion: username/password manipulation (sign in, password reset, etc.)](#exclusion-usernamepassword-manipulation-sign-in-password-reset-etc)" you will clearly see why we've ended up in the state where we have a third type of endpoint: not an API, but a static page-serving endpoint, but something in-between. It's understandable we've arrived here, and there is no immediate threat with this structure - but it's out of place.

We would do well to:

1. Place these routes into a separate category, so we have "(1) API endpoints, (2) non-API endpoints, and (3) user signup endpoints" or similar.
2. The routes should be easily identified based on URL path - they should be under a common prefix, not under separate URLs as they are today.
3. We should ensure the logic for registering these routes is under a distinct location. Today, they are registered under, and inherit all of the middlewares of, the non-API page routes. That is not ideal and could be risky long-term if that logic changes at all without an understanding of how it could impact these "UI routes" (as they are called in code.)

### Remove our CSRF tokens

This may be completed at ANY time. It has NO pre-requisites.

As described in "[How we protect against CSRF in non-API endpoints](#how-we-protect-against-csrf-in-non-api-endpoints)", our existing CSRF tokens are actually _detrimental to security_, and add complexity which has _provably harmed our security in the past_. This is a case where security-in-depth has caused us harm: if we did not have these CSRF tokens, customers would provably have not run into these security incidents.

There are of course other fixes we can take in this area, such as ensuring user IDs between Redis and Postgres are impossible to mix (this document speaks only about CSRF threats); or investing heavily in improving and understanding our CSRF token model - but it is absolutely NOT required at all as it is only a secondary means of protection today. My firm belief is that we are better off keeping our CSRF threat model simple, so that everyone can understand it.

There is no immediate risk here, however, in not removing these. They have been in place for several years and it has been at least 2 years since a customer has ran into this, and we've added documentation and other preventative measures against the issues we've faced here in the past.

We should remove them. Tracking issue from several years ago, concluding the same thing: https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/7658

### API endpoints should default to CORS `*` IFF access token authentication is being performed

This may be completed at ANY time. It has NO pre-requisites.

This one is really a no-brainer, really:

1. GitHub, for example, does this with their API.
2. This is clearly desired by both customers and ourselves alike:
   1. Sourcegraph @search team: [no CORS header for streaming API #23140](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/23140)
   2. github1s.com's author requesting API access: [Bug: Using Sourcegraph.com GraphQL API from other websites is broken #18847](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/18847)
   3. Various enterprise customers requesting it.
3. By making our API endpoints CORS-restrictive as they are today, even when access token authentication is being performed, we have pushed ourselves and customers into performing more risky behavior by allowing "trusted" origins in their site `corsOrigin` setting (or, much worse, setting it to `"*"`). Again, this is much worse than having a CORS setting of `*` IFF token authentication is being performed. See "[How we protect against CSRF in API endpoints](#how-we-protect-against-csrf-in-api-endpoints)", "[Known issue](#known-issue)"

### Deprecate `corsOrigin`, add `api.corsOrigin`

This may be completed at ANY time. It has NO pre-requisites.

Think about this for a minute: `corsOrigin` allows one the privilege of performing CSRF attacks against a Sourcegraph instance, even against endpoints like:

* Sign up
* Site initialization (admin account creation)
* Sign in
* Sign out
* Reset password
* Reset password code entry
* Verify email
* Checking if username is taken

This is not helpful, nobody should be using these endpoints outside of Sourcegraph's own site. What people *do* need, however, is the ability to set the CORS origin specifically for our API endpoints.

That is because there ARE origins where session-based authentication with Sourcegraph's API should be allowed:

* The browser extension
* Code hosts
* Trusted internal tools at enterprise deployments
* etc.

It should be possible for a site admin to configure the CORS policy for the API (`api.corsOrigin`) without granting CORS access to all our other routes - which is NOT useful.
