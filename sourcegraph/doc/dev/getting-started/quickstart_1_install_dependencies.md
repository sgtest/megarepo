# Quickstart step 1: Install dependencies

> NOTE: Please see install instructions for [macOS](#macos) and [Ubuntu](#ubuntu) in succeeding sections.

Sourcegraph has the following dependencies:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) (v2.18 or higher)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (see current version in [`.tool-versions`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/main/.tool-versions))
- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (see current recommended version in [.nvmrc](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/main/.nvmrc))
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) (v18 or higher)
  - For macOS we recommend using Docker for Mac instead of `docker-machine`
- [PostgreSQL](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides) (v12 or higher)
- [Redis](http://redis.io/) (v5.0.7 or higher)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (v1.10.1 or higher)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) tools
- [Golang Migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/) (v4.7.0 or higher)
- [Comby](https://github.com/comby-tools/comby/) (v0.11.3 or higher)
- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)

You can choose to install Redis and/or PostgreSQL directly on your system, or you can run them as docker containers with [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). The following instructions will describe both options.

Running within a container provides some advantages such as storing the data separately from the container, you do not need to run it as a system service and its easy to use different database versions or multiple databases.

Running as system services might yield better performance, especially on macOS.

No matter which option you choose, docker is required because the development server starts additional docker containers.

The following are two recommendations for installing these dependencies:

## macOS

1.  Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).
2.  Install [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/).

    optionally via `brew`

    ```
    brew install --cask docker
    ```

3.  Install Go, Yarn, Git, golang-migrate, Comby, SQLite tools, and jq with the following command:

    ```
    brew install go yarn git gnu-sed golang-migrate comby sqlite pcre FiloSottile/musl-cross/musl-cross jq watchman
    ```

4. (without docker) Install PostgreSQL and Redis

    If you want to run Redis and/or PostgreSQL directly on your system install them with the follwing command:

    ```
    brew install postgresql
    brew install redis
    ```

5. (with docker) Install Docker Compose

    We provide a docker compose file at `dev/redis-postgres.yml` to make it easy to run Redis and PostgreSQL as docker containers. Fortunately `docker-compose` comes with Docker for Mac so no additional step is required.

    See the official [docker compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

6.  Install the Node Version Manager (`nvm`) using:

    ```
    NVM_VERSION="$(curl https://api.github.com/repos/nvm-sh/nvm/releases/latest | jq -r .name)"
    curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/"$NVM_VERSION"/install.sh -o install-nvm.sh
    sh install-nvm.sh
    ```

    After the install script is finished, re-source your shell profile (e.g.,
    `source ~/.zshrc`) or restart your terminal session to pick up the `nvm`
    definitions. Re-running the install script will update the installation.

    > NOTE: `nvm` is implemented as a shell function, so it may not show up in
    the output of `which nvm`. Use `type nvm` to verify whether it is set up.
    There is also a Homebrew package for `nvm`, but it is unsupported by the
    `nvm` maintainers.

    * For fish shell users, you will want to install `bass` which you can get via `omf`:

        ```
        curl -L https://get.oh-my.fish | fish
        omf install bass
        ```

    * Then add the following to your `config.fish`:

        ```sh
        function nvm
          bass source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh --no-use ';' nvm $argv
        end

        set -x NVM_DIR ~/.nvm
        ```

7.  Install the current recommended version of Node JS by running the following
    from the working directory of a sourcegraph repository clone:

    ```
    nvm install
    nvm use --delete-prefix
    ```

    After doing this, `node -v` should show the same version mentioned in
    `.nvmrc` at the root of the sourcegraph repository.

    > NOTE: Although there is a Homebrew package for Node, we advise using `nvm`
    instead, to ensure you get a Node version compatible with the current state
    of the sourcegraph repository.

8.  (optional) Configure PostgreSQL and Redis to start automatically

    If you have installed PostgreSQL and Redis directly on your system, start them with the following commands:

    ```
    brew services start postgresql
    brew services start redis
    ```

    You can stop them later by calling `stop` instead of `start` above.

9.  Ensure `psql`, the PostgreSQL command line client, is on your `$PATH`.
    Homebrew does not put it there by default. Homebrew gives you the command to run to insert `psql` in your path in the "Caveats" section of `brew info postgresql`. Alternatively, you can use the command below. It might need to be adjusted depending on your Homebrew prefix (`/usr/local` below) and shell (bash below).

    ```
    hash psql || { echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/postgresql/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile }
    source ~/.bash_profile
    ```

10.  Open a new Terminal window to ensure `psql` is now on your `$PATH`.

## Ubuntu


1. Add package repositories:

    ```
    # Go
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:longsleep/golang-backports

    # Docker
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

    # Yarn
    curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
    ```

2. Update repositories:

    ```
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```
    sudo apt install -y make git-all libpcre3-dev libsqlite3-dev pkg-config golang-go musl-tools docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io yarn jq libnss3-tools

    # (without docker) install PostgreSQL and/or Redis if you don't want to run them as docker containers
    sudo apt install -y redis-server
    sudo apt install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib

    # install golang-migrate (you must rename the extracted binary to `golang-migrate` and move the binary into your $PATH)
    curl -L https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/releases/download/v4.7.0/migrate.linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xvz

    # install comby (you must rename the extracted binary to `comby` and move the binary into your $PATH)
    curl -L https://github.com/comby-tools/comby/releases/download/0.11.3/comby-0.11.3-x86_64-linux.tar.gz | tar xvz

    # install watchman (you must put the binary and shared libraries on your $PATH and $LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
    curl -LO https://github.com/facebook/watchman/releases/download/v2020.07.13.00/watchman-v2020.07.13.00-linux.zip
    unzip watchman-*-linux.zip
    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/{bin,lib} /usr/local/var/run/watchman
    sudo cp bin/* /usr/local/bin
    sudo cp lib/* /usr/local/lib
    sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/watchman
    sudo chmod 2777 /usr/local/var/run/watchman
    # On Linux, you may need to run the following in addition:
    watchman watch <path to sourcegraph repository>

    # nvm (to manage Node.js)
    NVM_VERSION="$(curl https://api.github.com/repos/nvm-sh/nvm/releases/latest | jq -r .name)"
    curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/"$NVM_VERSION"/install.sh -o install-nvm.sh
    sh install-nvm.sh

    # in repo dir: install current recommendend version of Node JS
    nvm install
    ```

3. (with docker) Install Docker Compose

    We provide a docker compose file at `dev/redis-postgres.yml` to make it easy to run Redis and PostgreSQL as docker containers.

    > NOTE: Although Ubuntu provides a `docker-compose` package, we recommend to install the latest version via `pip` so that it is compatible with our compose file.

    See the official [docker compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for more details on different installation options.

4. (without docker) Configure startup services

    If you have installed PostgreSQL and Redis directly on your system, start them with the following commands:

    ```
    sudo systemctl enable --now postgresql
    sudo systemctl enable --now redis-server.service
    ```

## (optional) asdf

[asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) is a CLI tool that manages runtime versions for a number of different languages and tools. It can be likened to a language-agnostic version of [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

We use asdf in buildkite to lock the versions of the tools that we use on a per-commit basis.

### Install
