### Try Sourcegraph locally

You can quickly try out Sourcegraph locally using Docker, which takes only a few minutes and lets you try out all of its features:

<!--
  DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO A CODEBLOCK.
  We want line breaks for readability, but backslashes to escape them do not work cross-platform.
  This uses line breaks that are rendered but not copy-pasted to the clipboard.
-->

<pre class="pre-wrap start-sourcegraph-command" id="dockerInstall"><code>docker run -d<span class="virtual-br"></span> --publish 7080:7080 --publish 127.0.0.1:3370:3370 --rm<span class="virtual-br"></span> --volume ~/.sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph<span class="virtual-br"></span> --volume ~/.sourcegraph/data:/var/opt/sourcegraph<span class="virtual-br"></span> sourcegraph/server:3.41.0<span class="iconify copy-text" data-icon="mdi:clipboard-arrow-left-outline" data-inline="false"></span></code>
</pre>

For next steps, visit the [Docker deployment documentation](admin/deploy/docker-single-container/index.md).

> NOTE: Due to the Windows enviroment, using Sourcegraph with Windows currently isn't fully supported. Testing instructions for running Sourcegraph locally on a Windows machine can be found [here](admin/deploy/docker-single-container/index.md#testing-sourcegraph-on-windows)

> WARNING: **We *do not* recommend using this method for a production instance** - see [Getting started](#getting-started) for more options.
