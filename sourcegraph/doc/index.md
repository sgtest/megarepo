# Sourcegraph documentation

> NOTE: Upgrading to `3.0.1+`? Read our [migration guide](admin/migration/3_0.md) for `2.x` and `3.0.0`.

[Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com) is used by developers at Uber, Lyft, Yelp, and more to help them search, navigate and review code at enterprise scale.

## Quickstart guide

> NOTE: If you get stuck or need help, [file an issue](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/new?&title=Improve+Sourcegraph+quickstart+guide), [tweet (@srcgraph)](https://twitter.com/srcgraph) or [email](mailto:support@sourcegraph.com?subject=Sourcegraph%20quickstart%20guide).


It takes less than 5 minutes to install Sourcegraph using Docker. If you've got [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), you're ready to start the server which listens on port `7080` by default.

<!--
  DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO A CODEBLOCK.
  We want line breaks for readability, but backslashes to escape them do not work cross-platform.
  This uses line breaks that are rendered but not copy-pasted to the clipboard.
-->

<pre class="pre-wrap"><code>docker run<span class="virtual-br"></span> --publish 7080:7080 --publish 2633:2633 --rm<span class="virtual-br"></span> --volume ~/.sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph<span class="virtual-br"></span> --volume ~/.sourcegraph/data:/var/opt/sourcegraph<span class="virtual-br"></span> sourcegraph/server:3.0.1</code></pre>

Access the server on port `7080`, then the below screencast will show you how to configure Sourcegraph to search public and private repositories, and enable code intelligence on Sourcegraph and GitHub.com.

Once Sourcegraph has been configured, head to the [site administration documentation](admin/index.md) for next steps.
