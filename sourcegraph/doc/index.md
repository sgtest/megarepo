# Sourcegraph documentation

Sourcegraph is a code search and browsing tool with code intelligence that helps developers write and review code. Learn more about Sourcegraph at [about.sourcegraph.com](https://about.sourcegraph.com) and use it at [Sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com).

Sourcegraph development is open source at [github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph). Need help? Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues).

## Quickstart

> NOTE: We're working on a **[new quickstart guide for Sourcegraph 3.0](quickstart.md)** and want your opinion on how we can make it better.

Run a self-hosted Sourcegraph instance in 1 command:

<!--
  DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO A CODEBLOCK.
  We want line breaks for readability, but backslashes to escape them do not work cross-platform.
  This uses line breaks that are rendered but not copy-pasted to the clipboard.
-->
<pre class="pre-wrap"><code>docker run<span class="virtual-br"></span> --publish 7080:7080 --publish 2633:2633 --rm<span class="virtual-br"></span> --volume ~/.sourcegraph/config:/etc/sourcegraph<span class="virtual-br"></span> --volume ~/.sourcegraph/data:/var/opt/sourcegraph<span class="virtual-br"></span> sourcegraph/server:3.0.0</code></pre>

Continue at http://localhost:7080, and see [administrator documentation](admin/index.md) for next steps.

## Sourcegraph subscriptions

You can use Sourcegraph in 2 ways:

- [Self-hosted Sourcegraph](admin/install/index.md): Deploy and manage your own Sourcegraph instance.
- [Sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com): For public code only. No signup or installation required.

For self-hosted Sourcegraph instances, you run a Docker image or Kubernetes cluster on-premises or on your preferred cloud provider. There are [2 tiers](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing): Core (free) and Enterprise. Enterprise features require a [Sourcegraph subscription](https://sourcegraph.com/user/subscriptions).
