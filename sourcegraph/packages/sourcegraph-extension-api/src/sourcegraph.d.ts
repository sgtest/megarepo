/**
 * ## The Sourcegraph extension API
 *
 * Sourcegraph extensions enhance your code host, code reviews, and Sourcegraph itself by adding features such as:
 * - Code intelligence (go-to-definition, find references, hovers, etc.)
 * - Test coverage overlays
 * - Links to live traces, log output, and performance data for a line of code
 * - Git blame
 * - Usage examples for functions
 *
 * Check out the [extension authoring documentation](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/extensions/authoring) to get started.
