Sourcegraph gives GitHub IDE-like powers when you're viewing code, PRs, or diffs:

1) jump to definition
2) hover over to see documentation and type info

Code on GitHub.com becomes fully interactive, so you don't have to context-switch back and forth between multiple browser tabs, your terminal, and your code editor. Sourcegraph integrates seamlessly into the GitHub workflow and UI.

After you install it, view some code on GitHub and mouse over some identifiers:

* Go: https://github.com/gorilla/mux/blob/master/mux.go
* TypeScript: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/modules/%40angular/benchpress/src/reporter/console_reporter.ts

If the extension isn't working on a specific repository, email support@sourcegraph.com or Tweet to @srcgraph. (Please don't post a review to report issues; we can fix them much faster if you contact us directly.)
