# This file defines timeouts in evergreen that will override the default timeouts.
#
# Each key under `overrides` provides the build variant where the override will occur. The
# override should include the `task` that should have its timeout overridden and either the
# `exec_timeout` to override or the `idle_timeout` to override.
#
# The timeouts should be specified in minutes.

# Note: In order to make it easier to find existing entries, please try to keep the build variants
# in alphabetical order.
