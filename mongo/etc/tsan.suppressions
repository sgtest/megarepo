# WiredTiger is known to cause false positives for data races because it uses a
# nonstandard thread model that TSAN doesn't know how to deal with. We have
# already denylisted WiredTiger in TSAN, but that only affects threads created
# within the WiredTiger source. For threads that call *into* WiredTiger, we
# need to add suppressions so we still get any potential failures from
# elsewhere.
#
# This is a temporary addition for now because it's possible that these are
# real positives that we need to do something with. However, because we know
# that false positives are more likely, we're deferring them until we have
# fixed the ones we know are real.
