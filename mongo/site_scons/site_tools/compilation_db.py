# Implements the ability for SCons to emit a compilation database for the MongoDB project. See
# http://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html for details on what a compilation
# database is, and why you might want one. The only user visible entry point here is
# 'env.CompilationDatabase'. This method takes an optional 'target' to name the file that
# should hold the compilation database, otherwise, the file defaults to compile_commands.json,
# which is the name that most clang tools search for by default.

# TODO: Is there a better way to do this than this global? Right now this exists so that the
# emitter we add can record all of the things it emits, so that the scanner for the top level
# compilation database can access the complete list, and also so that the writer has easy
# access to write all of the files. But it seems clunky. How can the emitter and the scanner
# communicate more gracefully?
