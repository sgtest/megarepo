# TODO (SERVER-87249): This feature flag exists because the new FTDC format depends on whether the
# router service is present, but there is no way to check for that from jstests, so this feature
# flag is used for that. Enabling it in "all feature flags" suites would break many tests because
# those tests don't enable the embedded router. It can be removed once featureFlagEmbeddedRouter is
# synonym of "there is a router service".
