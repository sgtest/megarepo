# This suite is based on the sharded_collections_jscore passthrough suite. It is used for testing
# that on a single-shard cluster there is no feature parity issue between connecting to a mongos or
# the router port of a mongod and connecting to the shard port of a mongod with replica set endpoint
# enabled. When feature parity is achieved, the set of tests disabled in this suite should be the
# same as the set of tests disabled in the sharded_collections_jscore passthrough suite.
