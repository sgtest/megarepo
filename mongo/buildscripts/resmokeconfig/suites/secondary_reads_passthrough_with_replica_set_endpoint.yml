# This suite is based on the secondary_reads passthrough suite. It is used for testing that
# there is no feature parity issue between secondary reads on a replica set before and after it
# has been bootstrapped as a single-shard cluster as long as the replica set endpoint is enabled.
# It is also used for testing that the replica set endpoint skips readPreference re-targeting. It
# does that by running read commands against each secondary directly rather than letting the
# shell do the readPreference targeting, and then at the end it checks the profiler collections
# to verify each secondary only ran the commands it got directly from the shell, i.e. the replica
# set endpoint does not route the command to the primary or a different secondary.
#
# When feature parity is achieved, the set of tests disabled in this suite should be the same as
# the set of tests disabled in the secondary_reads passthrough suite.
