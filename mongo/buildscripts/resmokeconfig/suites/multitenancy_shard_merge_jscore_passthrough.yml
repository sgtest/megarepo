  This passthrough runs the shard merge migration in multitenancy while testing different jstests.
  Starts two 3-node replica sets and uses the ContinuousShardMerge hook to run background tenant
  migrations. It also wraps all CRUD commands in transactions and asserts that the transactions are
  committed/aborted correctly while shard merges are running.

  # migration has occurred and would not forward the read/write command to the right replica set.
