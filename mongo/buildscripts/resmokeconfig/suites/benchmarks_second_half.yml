  # Please always add the glob pattern for the canary tests as part of "include_files" section when
  # defining a new test suite for your benchmarks. Doing so ensures they'll still run as part of the
  # Evergreen task associated with the new test suite.

  # Note: There is no explicit include_files list here. Instead, we automatically get everything
  # from benchmarks.txt, and then subtract the entries from benchmarks_first_half.yml (see below).
