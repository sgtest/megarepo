# TODO: SERVER-75596 delete this suite and run aggregation through RunQueryStats hook as well.
test_kind: js_test
description: |
  This suite enables the collection of query stats metrics on a mongod server, then runs the tests in
  aggregation as normal. This should cause each query or aggregation to compute a query
  shape and query stats key, and record in-memory some metrics like execution time and number of
  scanned documents.
