# This suite tests that secondaries getting abrubptly killed while performing change collection
# removal do not display consistency holes when recovering. The primary is prevented from performing
# any removal so that a secondary containing a hole is detected as the documents when read in
# descending order (most recent -> oldest) wouldn't match.
