# Evergreen task documentation
#
# If you are adding/updating task documentation, please follow this syntax:
# evergreen_task_name: |-
#   documentation line
#   the next documentation line
#
# This will allow to print out the documentation nicely as a multiline string
# to stdout, which would show up in Evergreen task logs next to the verbatim
# resmoke invocation.
#
# Please limit each line to 80 characters.

jsCore: |-
  Core set of lightweight tasks run against a standalone mongod.

noPassthrough: |-
  "Passthrough" means running a test against different runtime Cluster
  configurations, including topology, runtime flags, fault injections, and other
  parameters. Most tests by default are able to run in "passthrough" suites.
  NoPassthrough is an exception, where tests here only run in the exact
  configuration predefined in the tests themselves.
