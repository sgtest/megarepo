# Evergreen task documentation
#
# If you are adding/updating task documentation, please follow this syntax:
# evergreen_task_name: |-
#   documentation line
#   the next documentation line
#
# This will allow to print out the documentation nicely as a multiline string
# to stdout, which would show up in Evergreen task logs next to the verbatim
# resmoke invocation.
#
# Please limit each line to 80 characters.

jsCore: |-
  Core set of lightweight tasks run against a standalone mongod.

noPassthrough: |-
  "Passthrough" means running a test against different runtime Cluster
  configurations, including topology, runtime flags, fault injections, and other
  parameters. Most tests by default are able to run in "passthrough" suites.
  NoPassthrough is an exception, where tests here only run in the exact
  configuration predefined in the tests themselves.

cqf: |-
  Tests in jstests/cqf/ which stress the new query framework, often with a focus
  on the new optimizer. These are similar in spirit to the tests in the jscore
  suite. Tests in this suite are _forced_ to use the new query optimizer by
  using the server parameter 'internalQueryFrameworkControl': "forceBonsai".

cqf_disabled_pipeline_opt: |-
  A passthrough suite of the tests in the cqf suite with a failpoint used to
  disable the optimization pass that happens over the Pipeline structure before
  the query enters the new optimization framework. Tests in this suite are
  _forced_ to use the new query optimizer by using the server parameter
  'internalQueryFrameworkControl': "forceBonsai".

cqf_parallel: |-
  A passthrough suite of the tests in the cqf suite with parallelism enabled in
  the optimizer - meaning it can produce plans capable of being executed in
  parallel. The optimizer will use a default degree of parallelism of 5. Tests
  in this suite are _forced_ to use the new query optimizer by using the server
  parameter 'internalQueryFrameworkControl': "forceBonsai".
