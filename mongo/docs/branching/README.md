# Branching

This document describes branching task regarding file updates in `10gen/mongo` repository that should be done on a new branch after a branch cut.

- [2. Update files](#2-update-files)
  - [Copybara configuration](#copybara-configuration)

## 1. Create working branch

To save time during the branch cut these branching changes could be done beforehand, but not too early to avoid extra file conflicts, and then rebased on a new `vX.Y` branch.

Create a working branch from `master` or from a new `vX.Y` branch if it already exists:

```sh
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout -b vX.Y-branching-task
```

## 2. Update files

**IMPORTANT!** All of these changes should be a separate commit, but they should be pushed together in the same commit-queue task.

The reason they should be pushed as separate commits is in the case of needing to revert one aspect of this entire task.

### Copybara configuration

`copybara.sky` and `copybara.staging.sky`

- Update "master" branch references with a new branch name

### Evergreen YAML configurations

#### Nightly YAML

- `etc/evergreen_nightly.yml` will be used as YAML configuration for a new `mongodb-mongo-vX.Y` evergreen project

  - Copy over commit-queue aliases and patch aliases from `etc/evergreen.yml`
  - Update "include" section - comment out or uncomment file includes as instructions in the comments suggest.

    This will move some build variants from `etc/evergreen.yml` to continue running on a new branch project.
    More information about build variants after branching is [here](../evergreen-testing/yaml_configuration/buildvariants.md#build-variants-after-branching).

- `burn_in_tags` configuration

  - Remove build variant names from ["burn_in_tag_include_build_variants" expansion](https://github.com/10gen/mongo/blob/41ebdd14567ee35bdda0942958a5dc193f97dd5f/etc/evergreen_yml_components/variants/misc/misc.yml#L21) that are not included in `etc/evergreen_nightly.yml`

- Remove all-feature-flags configuration from build variants

  - Build variant names:

    - `enterprise-windows-all-feature-flags-required`
    - `rhel80-debug-aubsan-lite-all-feature-flags-required`

  - Actions:

    - Remove `all-feature-flags` from their names and display names
    - Remove `--runAllFeatureFlagTests` from `test_flags` expansion
    - Replace `!.incompatible_all_feature_flags` tag selectors with `!.requires_all_feature_flags`

- Promote build variants from "suggested" to "required"

  - Build variant names:

    - `enterprise-amazon-linux2-arm64`

  - Actions:

    - Replace "\*" with "!" in their display names
    - Replace "suggested" variant tag with "required"

#### Sys-perf YAML

- `etc/system_perf.yml` will be used as YAML configuration for a new `sys-perf-X.Y` evergreen project

  - Remove `etc/evergreen_yml_components/variants/perf/perf.yml` from "include" section

### Other files

- `buildscripts/generate_version_expansions.py`

  - Update [suffixes](https://github.com/10gen/mongo/blob/41ebdd14567ee35bdda0942958a5dc193f97dd5f/buildscripts/generate_version_expansions.py#L64-L65) from "latest" to "vX.Y-latest", where `vX.Y` is a new branch name

## 3. Test changes

In case working branch was created from `master` branch, rebase it on a new `vX.Y` branch and fix file conflicts if any.

Schedule required patch on a new `mongodb-mongo-vX.Y` project:

```sh
evergreen patch -p mongodb-mongo-vX.Y -a required
```

If patch results reveal that some steps are missing or outdated in this file, make sure to update the branching documentation on a "master" branch accordingly.

## 4. Merge changes

All the commits should be pushed together in the same commit-queue task:

```sh
evergreen commit-queue merge -p mongodb-mongo-vX.Y
```
