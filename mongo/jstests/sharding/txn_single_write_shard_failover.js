/**
 * Runs a single-write-shard transaction which commits, but for which the client retries commit and
 * a read-only shard fails over before the second commit attempt.
 *
 * The second commit attempt should still return a commit decision.
 *
 * This test was written to reproduce the bug in the original single-write-shard transaction commit
 * optimization where if a read-only shard failed over before the client sent a second commit
 * attempt, the second commit attempt would return NoSuchTransaction with TransientTransactionError,
 * causing the client to retry the whole transaction at a higher transaction number and the
 * transaction's write to be applied twice.
