/**
 * When a view is defined on a sharded collection, read of that view results in the following:
 *  1) mongos executes the view read against the primary shard, agnostic to whether the read
 *     is on a view or an unsharded collection.
 *  2) The primary shard resolves the view and on determining that the underlying collection is
 *     sharded, returns an 'CommandOnShardedViewNotSupportedOnMongod' error to mongos, with the
 *     resolved view definition attached.
 *  3) mongos rewrites the query and resolved view definition to be an aggregate on the underlying
 *     collection and executes.
 *
 * This test confirms that this rewrite mechanism is only used when the underlying collection is
 * sharded. If not sharded then the primary shard can perform the rewrite locally and execute
 * without having to round-trip back to mongos.
 *
 * @tags: [
