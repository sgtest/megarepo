/**
 * Technically this is not time series colleciton test; however, due to legacy behavior, a user
 * inserts into a collection in time series bucket namespace is required not to fail.  Please note
 * this behavior is likely going to be corrected in 6.3 or after. The presence of this test does
 * not imply such behavior is supported.
 *
 * As this tests code path relevant to time series, the requires_tiemseries flag is set to avoid
 * incompatible behavior related to multi statement transactions.
