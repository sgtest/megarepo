/**
 * Tests for bucket compression behavior when performing inserts to a time-series collection.
 * Normally, we only compress buckets when a bucket is full (closed). However, when the
 * TimeseriesAlwaysUseCompressedBuckets feature flag is on, an insert will insert a compressed
 * bucket into a time-series collection.
 *
 * @tags: [
 *   # This test depends on certain writes ending up in the same bucket. Stepdowns and tenant
