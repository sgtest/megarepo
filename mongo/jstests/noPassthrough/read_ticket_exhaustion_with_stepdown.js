/**
 * Tests exhaustion of read tickets, trying to force a deadlock reproduction
 * after yield restores lock state. See SERVER-75205 for more information.
 *
 * Deadlock:
 * The deadlock in question involves readers acquiring the RSTL lock, which no longer
 * happens in 5.0+ due to lock-free reads. Therefore, this test doesn't exercise the
 * deadlock behavior on 5.0+. 4.4 is the primary target of this test, but there isn't
 * much test coverage of ticket exhaustion, so this test may provide other benefits on
 * 5.0+.
 *
 * Parallel Shell Coordination:
 * The 'jsTestName().timing_coordination' collection is used to coordinate timing
 * between the main thread of the test and all the readers via writes to specific
 * documents. One side will wait until the document appears.
 *
 * Test Steps:
 * 0) Start ReplSet with special params:
 *     - lower read ticket concurrency
 *     - increase yielding
 * 1) Insert kNumDocs documents.
 * 2) Kick off many parallel readers that perform long collection scans that are subject to yields.
 * 3) Wait for many parallel read shells to run.
 * 4) Hold tickets before they're given back to the pool. This is what ensures that we're holding
 *    all of the read tickets before the stepdown so that one of the readers has to yield.
 * 5) Wait for many parallel readers to run.
 * 6) Ensure that there are no available read tickets.
 * 7) Hold stepDown so that we know that upon release, it will need a read ticket ~immediately.
 * 8) Initiate stepDown.
 * 9) Hold tickets again, verify state, unlock, and proceed with stepDown.
 *    <<Should deadlock here for this scenario>>
 * 10) Stop readers and clean up.
