# This file provides the neccesary commands to implement the sharded catalog index protocol. 
#
# The protocol to register an index works the following way:
# 1. While the migrations are disallowed and the critical section is taken for the collection,
#   a DDLCoordinator calls _shardsvrCommitIndexParticipant in all shards that contain data in the
#   base collection. This will effectively write the catalog entry locally and will bump the index
#   version in the collections collection.
# 2. The DDLCoordinator calls _configsvrCommitIndex to commit the index entry in the config server
#   transactionally.
# 3. The critical sections can be freed in all shards and the migrations can be allowed again.
#
# To unregister an index, the process is the same, but, instead of using 
# _shardsvrCommitIndexParticipant and _configsvrCommitIndex, we use 
# _shardsvrDropIndexCatalogEntryParticipant and _configsvrDropIndexCatalogEntry respectively.
#
# Additionally in this file we have two functions to test the registering/unregistering process: 
# _shardsvrRegisterIndex and _shardsvrUnregisterIndex, which will be used by tests while the 
# DDLCoordinator is implemented.
