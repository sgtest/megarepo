/**
 * The TenantMigrationRecipientAccessBlocker is used to reject tenant reads at a point-in-time
 * before a recipient node reaches the consistent state after a tenant migration.
 *
 * When data cloning is finished (and therefore a consistent donor optime established) an opObserver
 * that is observing the recipient state document will create a
 * TenantMigrationRecipientAccessBlocker in state `kRejectReadsAndWrites` that will reject all
 * commands (with IllegalOperation) for that tenant. If a command is received during this
 * `kRejectReadsAndWrites` phase it suggests that something is wrong with the proxy since traffic
 * should not be routed to the recipient yet.
 *
 * When oplog application reaches this consistent point, the recipient primary will wait for
 * the earlier state document write to be committed on all recipient nodes before doing the state
 * machine write for the consistent state. The TenantMigrationRecipientAccessBlocker, upon seeing
 * the write for the consistent state, will transition to `kRejectReadsBefore` state with the
 * `rejectBeforeTimestamp` set to the recipient consistent timestamp and will start allowing reads
 * for read concerns which read the latest snapshot, and "atClusterTime" or "majority" read concerns
 * which are after the `rejectBeforeTimestamp`. Reads for older snapshots, except "majority" until
 * the majority snapshot for a node reaches the `rejectBeforeTimestamp`, will be rejected with
 * SnapshotTooOld. Reads for "majority" when the majority snapshot is before the
 * `rejectBeforeTimestamp` will be blocked until the majority committed snapshot reaches that
 * timestamp.
 *
 * To ensure atClusterTime and afterClusterTime reads are consistent, when the recipient receives a
 * recipientSyncData command with a returnAfterReachingTimestamp after the consistent point, the
 * `rejectBeforeTimestamp` will be advanced to the given returnAfterReachingTimestamp.
 *
 * Blocker excludes all operations with 'tenantMigrationInfo' decoration set, as they are
 * internal.
