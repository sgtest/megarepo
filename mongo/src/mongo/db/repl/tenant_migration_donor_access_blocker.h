/**
 * The TenantMigrationDonorAccessBlocker is used to block and reject reads, writes and index builds
 * to a database while the Atlas Serverless tenant that owns the database is being migrated from
 * this replica set to another replica set.
 *
 * In order to preserve causal consistency across the migration, this replica set, the "donor",
 * blocks writes and reads as of a particular "blockTimestamp". The donor then advances the
 * recipient's clusterTime to "blockTimestamp" before committing the migration.
 *
 * Writes call checkIfCanWrite after being assigned an OpTime but before committing. If the
 * migration has committed, the method will throw TenantMigrationCommitted. If the migration has
 * aborted, the method will return an OK status and the writes can just proceed. Otherwise, if
 * writes are being blocked, the method will throw TenantMigrationConflict which will be caught by
 * tenant_migration_access_blocker::handleTenantMigrationConflict inside the ServiceEntryPoint. The
 * writes will then block until the migration either commits (in which case TenantMigrationCommitted
 * will be thrown) or aborts (in which case TenantMigrationAborted will be thrown). Writes are
 * blocked inside handleTenantMigrationConflict instead of checkIfCanWrite because writes must not
 * block between being assigned an OpTime and committing.
 *
 * Every command calls getCanRunCommand (via
 * tenant_migration_access_blocker::checkIfCanRunCommandOrBlock) at some point after waiting for
 * readConcern. If the migration has committed, the method will return TenantMigrationCommitted if
 * the command is in the commandDenyListAfterMigration. If the migration has aborted, the method
 * will return an OK status and the command can just proceed. Otherwise, if the command has
 * afterClusterTime or atClusterTime >= blockTimestamp, the promise will remain unfulfilled until
 * the migration either commits (in which case TenantMigrationCommitted will be returned) or aborts
 * (in which case an OK status will be returned and the command will be unblocked).
 *
 * Linearizable reads call checkIfLinearizableReadWasAllowed after doing the noop write at the end
 * the reads. The method returns TenantMigrationCommitted if the migration has committed, and an
 * OK status otherwise. The reads are not blocked in the blocking state because no writes to the
 * tenant's data can occur on the donor after the blockTimestamp, so a linearizable read only needs
 * to be rejected if it is possible that some writes have been accepted by the recipient (i.e. the
 * migration has committed).
 *
 * When opening new change streams without a resume token the server needs to pick a start time to
 * avoid reprocessing events that happened before the change stream was opened. This is usually the
 * optime of the last committed write in the oplog. However, while in the kBlockingWrites and
 * kBlockingWritesAndReads states, the latest global oplog time might wind up after the
 * blockTimestamp, so we to delay these commands by calling assertCanOpenChangeStream.
 *
 * Change stream getMore commands call assertCanGetMoreChangeStream. After a commit normal getMores
 * are allowed to proceed and drain the cursors, but change stream cursors are infinite and can't be
 * fully drained. We added this special check for change streams specifically to signal that they
 * must be resumed on the recipient.
 *
 * Index build user threads call checkIfCanBuildIndex. Index builds are blocked and rejected
 * similarly to regular writes except that they are blocked from the start of the migration (i.e.
 * before "blockTimestamp" is chosen).
 * Because there may be a race between the start of a migration and the start of an index build,
 * the index builder will call checkIfCanBuildIndex after registering the build.
 *
 * The Atlas proxy is responsible for retrying writes and reads that fail with
 * TenantMigrationCommitted against the recipient, and writes that fail with TenantMigrationAborted
 * against the donor.
 *
 * Given this, the donor uses this class's API in the following way:
 *
 * 1. The donor primary creates a WriteUnitOfWork to do a write, call it the "start blocking" write.
 * The donor primary calls startBlockingWrites before the write is assigned an OpTime. This write's
 * Timestamp will be the "blockTimestamp".
 *
 * At this point:
 * - Writes that have already passed checkIfCanWrite must have been assigned an OpTime before
 *   the blockTimestamp, since the blockTimestamp hasn't been assigned yet, and OpTimes are handed
 *   out in monotonically increasing order.
 * - Writes that have not yet passed checkIfCanWrite will end up blocking. Some of these
 *   writes may have already been assigned an OpTime, or may end up being assigned an OpTime that is
 *   before the blockTimestamp, and so will end up blocking unnecessarily, but not incorrectly.
 *
 * 2. In the op observer after the "start blocking" write's OpTime is set, primaries and secondaries
 * of the donor replica set call startBlockingReadsAfter with the write's Timestamp as
 * "blockTimestamp".
 *
 * At this point:
 * - Reads on the node that have already passed getCanRunCommand must have a clusterTime before
 *   the blockTimestamp, since the write at blockTimestamp hasn't committed yet (i.e., there's still
 *   an oplog hole at blockTimestamp).
 * - Reads on the node that have not yet passed getCanRunCommand will end up blocking.
 *
 * If the "start blocking" write aborts or the write rolls back via replication rollback, the node
 * calls rollBackStartBlocking.
 *
 * 4a. The donor primary commits the migration by doing another write, call it the "commit" write.
 * The op observer for the "commit" write on primaries and secondaries calls setCommitOpTime to
 * store the commit opTime when the write commits.
 *
 * 4b. The donor primary can instead abort the migration by doing a write, call it the "abort"
 * write. The op observer for the "abort" write on primaries and secondaries calls setAbortOpTime
 * to store the abort opTime when the write commits.
 *
 * The class transitions out of the blocking state when onMajorityCommitPointUpdate gets called with
 * commit opTime or abort opTime, which indicates that the "commit" or "abort" write has been
 * majority committed.
