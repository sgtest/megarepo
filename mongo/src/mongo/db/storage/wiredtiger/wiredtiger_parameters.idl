    # The "wiredTigerCursorCacheSize" parameter has the following meaning.
    #
    # wiredTigerCursorCacheSize == 0
    # For this setting, cursors are only cached in the WiredTiger storage engine
    # itself. Operations that need exclusive access such as drop or verify will
    # not be blocked by inactive cached cursors with this setting. However, this
    # setting may reduce the performance of certain workloads that normally
    # benefit from cursor caching above the storage engine.
    #
    # wiredTigerCursorCacheSize > 0
    # WiredTiger-level caching of cursors is disabled but cursor caching does
    # occur above the storage engine. The value of this setting represents the
    # maximum number of cursors that are cached. Setting the value to 10000 will
    # give the old (<= 3.6) behavior. Note that cursors remain cached, even when a
    # session is released back to the cache. Thus, exclusive operations may be
    # blocked temporarily, and in some cases, a long time. Drops that fail because
    # of exclusivity silently succeed and are queued for retries.
    #
    # wiredTigerCursorCacheSize < 0
    # This is a hybrid approach of the above two, and is the default. The the
    # absolute value of the setting is used as the number of cursors cached above
    # the storage engine. When a session is released, all cursors are closed, and
    # will be cached in WiredTiger. Exclusive operations should only be blocked
    # for a short time, except if a cursor is held by a long running session. This
    # is a good compromise for most workloads.
