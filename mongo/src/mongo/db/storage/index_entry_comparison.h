 * Describes a query that can be compared against an IndexKeyEntry in a way that allows

 * 'prefixLen' elements of 'keyPrefix' followed by the last 'keySuffix.size() - prefixLen' elements
 * of 'keySuffix'.
 *
 * The comparison is exclusive if 'firstExclusive' is non-negative, and any portion of the key after
 * that index will be omitted. The value of 'firstExclusive' must be at least 'prefixLen' - 1.
 *
 * e.g.
 *
 *  Suppose that
 *
 *      keyPrefix = { "" : 1, "" : 2 }
 *      prefixLen = 1
 *      keySuffix = [ IGNORED, { "" : 5 }, { "" : 9 } ]
