/**
 * Builder to assist in the construction of FieldActions.
 *
 * Just like a FieldAction, it represents a function from value (or Nothing) to value (or Nothing).
 * Also like FieldAction it does not distinguish between Keep and Drop, so you also need to know
 * a FieldListScope to disambiguate.
 *
 * However, in the case of LambdaArg and ValueArg, it does not track the index of the argument it
 * points to, but rather it may keep a pointer to a node in the ABT tree used to generate it. This
 * allows us to avoid materializing and lowering the arguments we will need for the final "makeObj"
 * primitive until we have completely constructed the MakeObjSpec. This is useful if, for example,
 * we can eliminate some ValueArgs on different sides of a composition. It also allows us to defer
 * lowering any part of the tree until we know exactly which subtrees need to be lowered (if any).
