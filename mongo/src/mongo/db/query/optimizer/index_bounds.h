/**
 * Used to pre-compute candidate indexes for SargableNodes.
 * We keep track of the following:
 *  1. Name of index this entry applies to. There may be multiple entries for the same index if we
 * have more than one equality prefix (see below).
 *  2. A map from index field to projection we deliver the field under. We can select which index
 * fields we want to bind to which projections.
 *  3. A vector of equality prefixes. The equality prefix refers to the predicates applied to each
 * of the index fields. It consists of 0+ equalities followed by at most one inequality, and
 * followed by 0+ unconstrained fields. For example, suppose we have an index consisting of five
 * fields with the following intervals applied to each: _field1: [0, 0], _field2: [1, 1], _field3:
 * [2, MaxKey], _field4: (unconstrained), _field5: [MinKey, 10], _field6: [100, MaxKey]. In this
 * example we have 3 equality prefixes: {_field1, field_2, field3, _field4}, {_field5}, {_field6}.
 * If we have more than one prefixes, we may choose to perform recursive index navigation. If in the
 * simplest case with one equality prefix we perform an index scan with some residual predicates
 * applied.
 *  4. Residual predicates. We may not satisfy all intervals directly by converting into index
 * bounds, and instead may satisfy some as residual predicates. Consider the example: _field1: [0,
 * MaxKey], _field2: [1, MaxKey]. If we were to constrain the candidate indexes to just one equality
 * prefix, we would create compound index bound [{0, MinKey}, {MaxKey, MaxKey}] effectively encoding
 * the interval over the first field into the bound, the binding _field2 to a temporary variable,
 * and applying a filter encoding [1, MaxKey] over the index scan.
 *  5. List of the predicate types applied to each field in the candidate index. This is needed
 * during the physical rewrite phase where we need to match the collation requirements with the
 * collation of the index. One use is to ignore collation requirements for fields which are
 * equalities.
