# About
This directory contains all the logic related to query optimization in the new
common query framework. It contains the models for representing a query and the
logic for implementing optimization via a cascades framework.

# Testing
Developers working on the new optimizer may wish to run a subset of the tests
which is exclusively focused on this codebase. This section details the relevant
tests. 
## Unit Tests
The following C++ unit tests exercise relevant parts of the codebase:

- algebra_test (src/mongo/db/query/optimizer/algebra/)
- db_pipeline_test (src/mongo/db/pipeline/)
- - This test suite includes many unrelated test cases, but
    'abt/abt_translation_test.cpp' and 'abt/abt_optimization_test.cpp' are the relevant ones.
- optimizer_test (src/mongo/db/query/optimizer/)
- sbe_abt_test (src/mongo/db/exec/sbe/abt/)

These can be compiled with targets like 'build/install/bin/algebra_test',
although the exact name will depend on your 'installDir' which you have
configured with SCons. It may look more like
'build/opt/install/bin/algebra_test'. If you want to build and run at once, you
can use the '+' shortcut to ninja, like so:
```
ninja <FLAGS> +algebra_test +db_pipeline_test +optimizer_test +sbe_abt_test
```

## JS Integration Tests
In addition to the above unit tests, the following JS suites are helpful in
exercising this codebase:
- **cqf**: [buildscripts/resmokeconfig/suites/cqf.yml](/buildscripts/resmokeconfig/suites/cqf.yml)
- **cqf_disabled_pipeline_opt**:
    [buildscripts/resmokeconfig/suites/cqf_disabled_pipeline_opt.yml](/buildscripts/resmokeconfig/suites/cqf_disabled_pipeline_opt.yml)
- **cqf_parallel**: [buildscripts/resmokeconfig/suites/cqf_parallel.yml](/buildscripts/resmokeconfig/suites/cqf_parallel.yml)
- **query_golden_cqf**: [buildscripts/resmokeconfig/suites/query_golden_cqf.yml](/buildscripts/resmokeconfig/suites/query_golden_cqf.yml)

Desriptions of these suites can be found in
[buildscripts/resmokeconfig/evg_task_doc/evg_task_doc.yml](/buildscripts/resmokeconfig/evg_task_doc/evg_task_doc.yml).

You may run these like so, adjusting the `-j` flag for the appropriate level of
parallel execution for your machine.
```
./buildscripts/resmoke.py run -j4 \
 --suites=cqf,cqf_disabled_pipeline_opt,cqf_parallel,query_golden_cqf
```

## Local Testing Recommendation
Something like this command may be helpful for local testing:
```
ninja <FLAGS> install-devcore build/install/bin/algebra_test \
build/install/bin/db_pipeline_test build/install/bin/optimizer_test \
build/install/bin/sbe_abt_test \
&& ./build/install/bin/algebra_test \
&& ./build/install/bin/db_pipeline_test --fileNameFilter=abt/.* \
&& ./build/install/bin/optimizer_test \
&& ./build/install/bin/sbe_abt_test \
&& ./buildscripts/resmoke.py run --suites=cqf,cqf_parallel,cqf_disabled_pipeline_opt,query_golden_cqf -j4
```
**Note:** You may need to adjust the path to the unit test binary targets if your
SCons install directory is something more like `build/opt/install/bin`.

## Evergreen Testing Recommendation
In addition to the above suites, there is a patch-only variant which enables the CQF feature flag
on a selection of existing suites. The variant, "Query (all feature flags and CQF enabled)", runs
all the tasks from the recommended all-feature-flags variants. When testing on evergreen, you
may want a combination of passthrough tests from the CQF variant and CQF-targeted tests (like the
integration suites mentioned above and unit tests) on interesting variants such as ASAN. 

You can define local evergreen aliases to make scheduling these tasks easier and faster than
selecting them individually on each evergreen patch. A discussion of evergreen aliases can be
found in the query team wiki.
