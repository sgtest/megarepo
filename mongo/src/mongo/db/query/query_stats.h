/**
 * Registers a request for query stats collection. The function may decide not to collect anything,
 * so this should be called for all requests. The decision is made based on the feature flag and
 * query stats rate limiting.
 *
 * The originating command/query does not persist through the end of query execution due to
 * optimizations made to the original query and the expiration of OpCtx across getMores. In order
 * to pair the query stats metrics that are collected at the end of execution with the original
 * query, it is necessary to store the original query during planning and persist it through
 * getMores.
 *
 * During planning, registerRequest is called to serialize the query stats key and save it to
 * OpDebug. If a query's execution is complete within the original operation,
 * collectQueryStatsMongod/collectQueryStatsMongos will call writeQueryStats() and pass along the
 * query stats key to be saved in the query stats store alongside metrics collected.
 *
 * However, OpDebug does not persist through cursor iteration, so if a query's execution will span
 * more than one request/operation, it's necessary to save the query stats context to the cursor
 * upon cursor registration. In these cases, collectQueryStatsMongod/collectQueryStatsMongos will
 * aggregate each operation's metrics within the cursor. Once the request is eventually complete,
 * the cursor calls writeQueryStats() on its destruction.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - It's important to call registerRequest with the original request, before canonicalizing or
 *   optimizing it, in order to preserve the user's input for the query shape.
 * - Calling this affects internal state. It should be called exactly once for each request for
 *   which query stats may be collected.
 * - The std::function argument to construct an abstracted RequestShapifier is provided to break
 *   library cycles so this library does not need to know how to parse everything. It is done as a
 *   deferred construction callback to ensure that this feature does not impact performance if
 *   collecting stats is not needed due to the feature being disabled or the request being rate
 *   limited.
