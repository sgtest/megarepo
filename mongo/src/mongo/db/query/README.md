# Query System Internals

## Overview

The query system is responsible for interpreting the user's request, finding an optimal way to
satisfy it, and to actually compute the results. It is primarily exposed through the `find` and
`aggregate` commands, but also used in associated read commands like `count`, `distinct`, and
`mapReduce`.

## Glossary

- <a id="glossary-Aggregation"></a>Aggregation: The subsystem that runs `aggregate` stages.
- <a id="glossary-BSON"></a>[BSON][bson]: Bin­ary-en­coded serialization of JSON-like documents. A
  data format developed by MongoDB for data representation in its core.
- <a id="glossary-CanonicalQuery"></a>[Canonical query][canonicalquery]: A standardized form for
  queries, in BSON. It works as a container for the parsed query and projection portions of the
  original query message. The filter portion is parsed into a
  [`MatchExpression`](#glossary-MatchExpression).
- <a id="glossary-DocumentSource"></a>DocumentSource: Represents one stage in an
  [`aggregation`](#glossary-Aggregation) [pipeline](#glossary-Pipeline); not necessarily
  one-to-one with the stages in the user-defined pipeline.
- <a id="glossary-ExpressionContext"></a>[ExpressionContext][expressioncontext]: An object that
  stores state that may be useful to access throughout the lifespan of a query, but is probably
  not relevant to any other operations. This includes the collation, a time zone database, various
  random booleans and state, etc.
- <a id="glossary-Find"></a>Find: The subsystem that runs [`find`](#glossary-Find) stages and
  [pushed-down](#glossary-Pushdown) [`aggregate`](#glossary-Aggregation) stages.
- <a id="glossary-IDL"></a>[IDL][idl]: Interface Definition Language. YAML-formatted files to
  generate C++ code.
- <a id="glossary-LiteParsedPipeline"></a>[LiteParsedPipeline][liteparsedpipeline]: A very simple
  model of an [`aggregate`](#glossary-Aggregation) [pipeline](#glossary-Pipeline). It is
  constructed through a semi-parse that proceeds just enough to tease apart the stages that are
  involved. It has neither verified that the input is well-formed, nor parsed the expressions or
  detailed arguments to the stages. It can be used for requests that we want to inspect before
  proceeding and building a full model of the user's query or request.
- <a id="glossary-MatchExpression"></a>MatchExpression: The parsed Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from
  the filter portion of the query.
- <a id="glossary-MQL"></a>MQL: MongoDB Query Language.
- <a id="glossary-Pipeline"></a>Pipeline: A list of [`DocumentSources`](#glossary-DocumentSource)
  which handles a part of the optimization.
- <a id="glossary-Pushdown"></a>Pushdown: Convert an [`aggregate`](#glossary-Aggregation)
  stage in the [pipeline](#glossary-Pipeline) to a [`find`](#glossary-Find) stage.
