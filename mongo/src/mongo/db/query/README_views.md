# Views

[Views] in MongoDB are a name and an [`aggregation`][aggregation] [pipeline][pipeline] targeting some
collection or other view. They are non-materialized (or on-demand) views which means the
`aggregation` pipeline defining the view must be executed on every request. They are also read only! There is a long-standing
request ([SERVER-27698][materialized views]) to add materialized views to MongoDB, where the view
would be stored to avoid executing on each query.

Because a view is an `aggregation` pipeline, if a command is issued against a view, it's internally transformed into an 'aggregate' command. As an example of this, see [runFindOnView()] for find commands and [rewriting a count command into aggregate command].

For `aggregate` commands, we check if the command was issued against a view. If it is,
[runAggregateOnView][runAggregateOnView] is called. The view is then resolved by prepending the
viewâ€™s pipeline to the current pipeline for the query and a new call to
[runAggregate()][runAggregate()] is called with the final query.
