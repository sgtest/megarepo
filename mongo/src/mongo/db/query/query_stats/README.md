# Query Stats
This directory is the home of the infrastructure related to recording query statistics for the
database. It is not to be confused with src/mongo/db/query/stats/ which is the home of the logic for
computing and maintaining statistics about a collection or index's data distribution - for use by
the query planner.

At the center of everything here is the QueryStatsStore, which essentially maps query shapes to some
metrics about how often each one occurs. For example, if the client does this:
```js
db.example.findOne({x: 24});
db.example.findOne({x: 53});
```
then the QueryStatsStore should contain an entry for a single query shape which would record 2
executions and some related statistics (see the QueryStatsEntry for details).

The query stats store actually uses _more_ dimensions (i.e. more granularity) to group incoming
queries than just the query shape. For example, these queries would all three have the same shape
but the first would have a different query stats store entry from the other two:
```js
db.example.find({x: 55});
db.example.find({x: 55}).batchSize(2);
db.example.find({x: 55}).batchSize(3);
```
There are two distinct query stats store entries here - both the examples which include the batch
size will be treated separately from the example which does not specify a batch size.

The dimensions considered will depend on the command, but can generally be found in the KeyGenerator
iterface, which will generate the QueryStatsStore keys by which we accumulate statistics.
