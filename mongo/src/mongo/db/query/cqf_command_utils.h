 * member of the currently assumed subset causing the eligibility to be reduced to a larger set. The
 * eligibility of a query is the smallest set which the query is a member of.
 *
 * The largest set, the set of all queries (aka Ineligible), includes not only those queries which
 * are supported by Bonsai in some capacity, but those which are not supported by Bonsai at all. The
 * next smaller set contains queries which are experimentally supported in Bonsai. They will not be
 * executed by Bonsai in a release configuration but are eligible in test configurations.
 * The smallest subset (aka FullyEligible) is the set of queries that execute correctly and
 * efficiently.
 *
 * This structure is a mutable object representing an eligibility level. It provides a fluent style
 * API which facilitates combining multiple constraints to compute the eligibility, eg.
 *
 * eligibility.setIneligibleIf(condition1)
