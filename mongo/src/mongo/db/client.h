     * improper usage could lead to a deadlock. More context comes as follows.
     *
     * How does this kill operation process work?
     * To be more clear, the kill operation is actually an interruption. In order to get the RSTL
     * lock during stepUp/stepDown, the replication coordinator will start a RstlKillOpThread to
     * interrupt all threads that may block it for the RSTL lock. The RstlKillOpThread will loop
     * through all threads and find out the threads that have ever taken a global lock in S/X/IX
     * mode. It will interrupt these threads by interrupting their opCtx, which will cause an
     * InterruptedDueToReplStateChange error to be thrown when the thread checks interruption on the
     * opCtx. In addition to those threads hold global locks, a thread could also be interrupted if
     * it is explicitly marked as alwaysInterruptAtStepDownOrUp or waiting on prepare conflicts.
     *
     * What should I consider if I introduced a new thread?
     * - Whether the new thread ever takes any global lock in S/IX/X mode? If not, the stepdown
     *   thread won't interrupt the new thread so we should leave it as killable. Even if the thread
     *   takes global lock, the best practice should be making the new thread killable and handle
     *   the interruption properly.
     * - It's always better to write the code in a way that can catch the
     *   InterruptedDueToReplStateChange error and recover from there. This helps make the thread
     *   killable in a safer way and can prevent deadlock from unkillable thread.
     * - If the thread has to be unkillable, it would be helpful to leave the reason in a comment so
     *   if it becomes an issue, it will be easier to find the cause.
