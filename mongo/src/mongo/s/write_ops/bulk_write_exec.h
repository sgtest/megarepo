 * The BulkWriteOp class manages the lifecycle of a bulkWrite request received by mongos. Each op in
 * the ops array is tracked via a WriteOp, and the function of the BulkWriteOp is to aggregate the
 * dispatched requests and responses for the underlying WriteOps.
 *
 * Overall, the BulkWriteOp lifecycle is similar to the WriteOp lifecycle, with the following
 * stages:
 *
 * 0) Client request comes in, a BulkWriteOp is initialized.
 *
 * 1a) One or more ops in the bulkWrite are targeted, resulting in TargetedWriteBatches for these
 *     ops.
 * 1b) There are targeting errors, and the batch must be retargeted after refreshing the NSTargeter.
 *
 * 2) Child bulkWrite requests are built for each TargetedWriteBatch before sending.
 *
 * 3) Responses for sent TargetedWriteBatches are noted, errors are stored and aggregated
 *    per-write-op. Errors the caller is interested in are returned.
 *
 * 4) If the whole bulkWrite is not finished, goto 0.
 *
 * 5) When all responses come back for all write ops, errors are aggregated and returned in
 *    a client response.
