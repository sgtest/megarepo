 * LatchAnalyzer is a ServiceContext decoration that aggregates latch events
 *
 * This class is intended to provide a platform for hierarchical analysis on latches. To that end,
 * onContention(), onAcquire(), and onRelease() are currently called by a
 * latch_detail::DiagnosticListener subclass defined in source. This class does much more work for
 * each event when the enableLatchAnalysis failpoint is set to "alwaysOn". This failpoint provides a
 * wealth of data for future analysis, but involves additional mutexes and mapping structures that
 * may prove too costly for production usage at the least.
