 *
 * For the moment, it is only returned by scheduleRemoteCommandOnAny, and should be thought of as a
 * different return type for that rpc api, rather than a higher-information RemoteCommandResponse.
 *
 * The target member may be used by callers to associate a HostAndPort with the remote or
 * local error that the RemoteCommandOnAnyResponse holds. The "status" member will be populated
 * with possible local errors, while the "data" member may hold any remote errors. For local
 * errors that are not caused by the remote (for example, local shutdown), the target member will
 * not be filled.
 *
 * For local errors, the response is associated (by the network interface) with a remote
 * HostAndPort for these cases:
 *   1. When acquiring a connection to the remote from the pool.
 *   2. When using the connection to the remote.
 *   3. Enforcing a timeout (propagated or internal) while using the connection to the remote.
