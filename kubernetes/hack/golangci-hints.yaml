# golangci-lint is used in Kubernetes with different configurations that
# enable an increasing amount of checks:
# - golangci.yaml is the most permissive configuration. All existing code
#   passed.
# - golangci-strict.yaml adds checks that all new code in pull requests
#   must pass.
# - golangci-hints.yaml adds checks for code patterns where developer
#   and reviewer may decide whether findings should get addressed before
#   merging. Beware that the golangci-lint output includes also the
#   issues that must be fixed and doesn't indicate how severe each issue
#   is (https://gophers.slack.com/archives/CS0TBRKPC/p1685721815275349).
#
# All three flavors are generated from golangci.yaml.in with
# hack/update-golangci-lint-config.sh.
