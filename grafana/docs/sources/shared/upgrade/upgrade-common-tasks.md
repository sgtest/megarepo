title: Upgrade guide common tasks
---

We recommend that you upgrade Grafana often to stay current with the latest fixes and enhancements.
Because Grafana upgrades are backward compatible, the upgrade process is straightforward, and dashboards and graphs will not change.

In addition to common tasks you should complete for all versions of Grafana, there might be additional upgrade tasks to complete for a version.

{{% admonition type="note" %}}
There might be breaking changes in some releases. We outline these changes in the [What's New ]({{< relref "../../whatsnew/" >}}) document for most releases or a separate [Breaking changes]({{< relref "../../breaking-changes/" >}}) document for releases with many breaking changes.

For versions of Grafana prior to v9.2, we published additional information in the [Release Notes]({{< relref "../../release-notes/" >}}).

When available, we list all changes with links to pull requests or issues in the [Changelog](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

When possible, we recommend that you test the Grafana upgrade process in a test or development environment.

## Back up the Grafana database

Although Grafana automatically upgrades the database on startup, we recommend that you back up your Grafana database so that you can roll back to a previous version, if required.

### SQLite

If you use SQLite, you only need to back up the `grafana.db` file. On Unix systems, the database file is usually located in `/var/lib/grafana/`.

If you are unsure which database you use and where it is stored, check the Grafana configuration file. If you
installed Grafana to a custom location using a binary tar/zip, the database is usually located in `<grafana_install_dir>/data`.

### MySQL

To back up or restore a MySQL Grafana database, run the following commands:

```bash
backup:
> mysqldump -u root -p[root_password] [grafana] > grafana_backup.sql

restore:
> mysql -u root -p grafana < grafana_backup.sql
```

### Postgres

To back up or restore a Postgres Grafana database, run the following commands:

```bash
backup:
> pg_dump grafana > grafana_backup

restore:
> psql grafana < grafana_backup
```

## Backup plugins

We recommend that you back up installed plugins before you upgrade Grafana so that you can roll back to a previous version of Grafana, if necessary.
