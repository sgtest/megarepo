# Display multiple y-axes

In some cases, you may want to display multiple y-axes. For example, if you have a dataset showing both temperature and humidity over time, you may want to show two y-axes with different units for these two series.

You can do this by [adding field overrides]({{< relref "../../panels-visualizations/configure-overrides#add-a-field-override" >}}). Follow the steps as many times as required to add as many y-axes as you need.
