# Additional setup

Alerting supports a plethora of configurations, from [configuring external Alertmanagers]({{< relref "./configure-alertmanager" >}}) to routing Grafana Managed Alerts outside of Grafana, to defining your alerting setup [as-code using Provisioning]({{< relref "./provision-alerting-resources" >}}).

Setup Grafana Alerting high-availability mode by [following this guide]({{< relref "./configure-high-availability" >}}).

Connect your alerting setup to Grafana OnCall by [following this guide](/docs/oncall/latest/integrations/available-integrations/add-grafana-alerting/).
