# Configure RBAC

Role-based access control (RBAC) for Grafana Enterprise and Grafana Cloud provides a standardized way of granting, changing, and revoking access, so that users can view and modify Grafana resources.

A user is any individual who can log in to Grafana. Each user is associated with a role that includes permissions. Permissions determine the tasks a user can perform in the system.

Each permission contains one or more actions and a scope.

## Permissions

Grafana Alerting has the following permissions.
