# Tempo query editor

The Tempo data source's query editor helps you query and display traces from Tempo in [Explore]({{< relref "../../../explore" >}}).

This topic explains configuration and queries specific to the Tempo data source.
For general documentation on querying data sources in Grafana, see [Query and transform data]({{< relref "../../../panels-visualizations/query-transform-data" >}}).

## Query by search

Use this to search for traces by service name, span name, duration range, or process-level attributes that are included in your application's instrumentation, such as HTTP status code and customer ID.

To configure Tempo and the Tempo data source for search, refer to [Configure the data source]({{< relref "../#configure-the-data-source" >}}).

To search for traces:

1. Select **Search** from the **Query** type selector.
1. Fill out the search form:

| Name             | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Service Name** | Returns a list of services.                                                                                                       |
| **Span Name**    | Returns a list of span names.                                                                                                     |
| **Tags**         | Sets tags with values in the [logfmt](https://brandur.org/logfmt) format, such as `error=true db.statement="select * from User"`. |
| **Min Duration** | Filters all traces with a duration higher than the set value. Possible values are `1.2s`, `100ms`, `500us`.                       |
| **Max Duration** | Filters all traces with a duration lower than the set value. Possible values are `1.2s`, `100ms`, `500us`.                        |
| **Limit**        | Limits the number of traces returned.                                                                                             |

### Search recent traces

You can search recent traces held in Tempo's ingesters.
By default, ingesters store the last 15 minutes of tracing data.

To configure your Tempo data source to use this feature, refer to the [Tempo documentation](/docs/tempo/latest/getting-started/tempo-in-grafana/#search-of-recent-traces).

### Search the backend datastore

Tempo includes the ability to search the entire backend datastore.

To configure your Tempo data source to use this feature, refer to the [Tempo documentation](/docs/tempo/latest/getting-started/tempo-in-grafana/#search-of-the-backend-datastore).

## Query by TraceID

To query a particular trace:

1. Select the **TraceQL** query type.
1. Enter the trace's ID into the query field.

## Query by TraceQL

Inspired by PromQL and LogQL, TraceQL is a query language designed for selecting traces.
The default traces search reviews the whole trace.
TraceQL provides a method for formulating precise queries so you can zoom in to the data you need.
Query results are returned faster because the queries limit what is searched.

To learn more about how to query by TraceQL, refer to the [TraceQL documentation](/docs/tempo/latest/traceql).

You can create TraceQL queries using the Query editor or using **Search** query type.

## Query Loki for traces

To find traces to visualize, you can use the [Loki query editor]({{< relref "../../loki#loki-query-editor" >}}).
For results, you must configure [derived fields]({{< relref "../../loki#configure-derived-fields" >}}) in the Loki data source that point to this data source.
