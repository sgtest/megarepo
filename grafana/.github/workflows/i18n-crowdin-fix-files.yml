            :robot: Automatic sync of translations from Crowdin.

            Steps for merging:
              1. Wait for the "Github Action: Auto-fix i18n files" commit that may be required for CI to pass.
              2. A quick sanity check of the changes and approve. Things to look out for:
                - No changes to the English strings. The source of truth is already in the main branch, NOT Crowdin.
                - Translations maybe be removed if the English phrase was removed, but there should not be many of these
                - Anything else that looks 'funky'. Ask if you're not sure.
              3. Approve & (Auto-)merge. :tada:

            If there's a conflict, close the pull request and **delete the branch**. Crowdin will recreate the pull request eventually.
            Remember, the longer this pull request is open, the more likely it is that it'll get conflicts.
