# Grid

The `Grid` component allows for the organized layout and alignment of content into a grid-based structure.

## Usage

### When to use

Use the Grid component when you want to create structured and organized layouts where content or elements need to be aligned in rows and columns for clarity and consistency.

### When not to use

Use the `Stack` component instead for these use cases:

- **Simple layouts:** When you need to arrange elements in a linear format, either vertically or horizontally.
- **Regular flow:** When you want a "regular" site flow but with standardized spacing between the elements.

Use the `Flex` component instead for these use cases:

- **Alignment:** More options for item alignment.
- **Flex items:** Custom flex basis or configure how items stretch and wrap.

## Properties

_Note: There is no support for using `columns` and `minColumnWidth` props at the same time. The correct behaviour is working just with one of them not both._
