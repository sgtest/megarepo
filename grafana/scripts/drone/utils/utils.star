    In addition to the parameters provided, it configures:
      - the use of an image pull secret
      - a retry count for cloning
      - a volume 'docker' that can be used to access the Docker socket

    Args:
      name: controls the pipeline name.
      edition: used to differentiate the pipeline for enterprise builds.
      trigger: a Drone trigger for the pipeline.
      steps: the Drone steps for the pipeline.
      services: auxiliary services used during the pipeline.
        Defaults to [].
      platform: abstracts platform specific configuration primarily for different Drone behavior on Windows.
        Defaults to 'linux'.
      depends_on: list of pipelines that must have succeeded before this pipeline can start.
        Defaults to [].
      environment: environment variables passed through to pipeline steps.
        Defaults to None.
      volumes: additional volumes available to be mounted by pipeline steps.
        Defaults to [].
