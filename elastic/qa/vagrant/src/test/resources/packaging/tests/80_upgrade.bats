# Tests upgrading elasticsearch from a previous version with the deb or rpm
# packages. Just uses a single node cluster on the current machine rather than
# fancy rolling restarts.

# WARNING: This testing file must be executed as root and can
# dramatically change your system. It should only be executed
# in a throw-away VM like those made by the Vagrantfile at
# the root of the Elasticsearch source code. This should
# cause the script to fail if it is executed any other way:
[ -f /etc/is_vagrant_vm ] || {
  >&2 echo "must be run on a vagrant VM"
  exit 1
}

# The test case can be executed with the Bash Automated
# Testing System tool available at https://github.com/sstephenson/bats
# Thanks to Sam Stephenson!
