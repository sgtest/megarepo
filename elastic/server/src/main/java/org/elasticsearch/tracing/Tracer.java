/**
 * Represents a distributed tracing system that keeps track of the start and end
 * of various activities in the cluster. Traces are composed of "spans", each of
 * which represents some piece of work with a duration. Spans are nested to
 * create a parent-child hierarchy.
 * <p>
 * You can open a span using
 * {@link #startTrace(ThreadContext, String, String, Map)}, and stop it using
 * {@link #stopTrace(String)}, at which point the tracing system will queue
 * the data to be sent somewhere for processing and storage.
 * <p>
 * You can add additional data to a span using the {@code setAttribute(...)}
 * methods, e.g.  {@link #setAttribute(String, String, String)}. This allows you
 * to attach data that is not available when the span is opened.
 * <p>
 * <b>Implementation node:</b> tracers have similar performance requirements to loggers,
 * in that they may be called in performance-sensitive locations. For example, network
 * requests must be queued on separate threads, in order to avoid blocking any
 * calling threads. Care should be taken to avoid allocating an excessive number of
 * objects.

     * Usually you won't need this about scopes when using tracing. However,
     * sometimes you may want more details to be captured about a particular
     * section of code. You can think of "scope" as representing the currently active
     * tracing context. Using scope allows the tracing agent to do the following:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Enables automatic correlation between the "active span" and logging, where logs have also been captured.
     *   <li>Enables capturing any exceptions thrown when the span is active, and linking those exceptions to the span.
     *   <li>Allows the sampling profiler to be used as it allows samples to be linked to the active span (if any), so the agent can
     *   automatically get extra spans without manual instrumentation.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>However, a scope must be closed in the same thread in which it was opened, which
     * cannot be guaranteed when using tasks.
     *
     * <p>Note that in the OpenTelemetry documentation, spans, scope and context are fairly
     * straightforward to use, since `Scope` is an `AutoCloseable` and so can be
     * easily created and cleaned up use try-with-resources blocks. Unfortunately,
     * Elasticsearch is a complex piece of software, and also extremely asynchronous,
     * so the typical OpenTelemetry examples do not work.
     *
     * <p>Nonetheless, it is possible to manually use scope where more detail is needed by
     * explicitly opening a scope via the `Tracer`.
     *
     * @param id an identifier for the span
     * @return a scope. You MUST close it when you are finished with it.
