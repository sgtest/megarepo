# This file is used as part of a matrix build in Jenkins where the
# values below are excluded from the test matrix.

# The yaml mapping below represents a single intersection on the build
# matrix where a test *should not* be run.  The value of the exclude
# key is a list of maps.

# In this example all of the combinations defined in the matrix will
# run except for the test that builds with java10 and runs with java8.
# exclude:
#   - ES_BUILD_JAVA: java10
#     ES_RUNTIME_JAVA: java8
