== Transforms

A _Transform_ processes and changes the payload in the watch execution context
to prepare it for the watch actions. {watcher} supports three types of 
transforms: <<transform-search, `search`>>,
<<transform-script, `script`>> and <<transform-chain, `chain`>>.


NOTE: Transforms are optional. When none are defined, the actions have access to
      the payload as loaded by the watch input.

You can define transforms in two places:

* As a top level construct in the watch definition. In this case, the payload is
  transformed before any of the watch actions are executed.

* As part of the definition of an action. In this case, the payload is
  transformed before that action is executed. The transformation is only applied
  to the payload for that specific action.

If all actions require the same view of the payload, define a transform as part
of the watch definition. If each action requires a different view of the payload,
define different transforms as part of the action definitions so each action has
the payload prepared by its own dedicated transform.

The following example defines two transforms, one at the watch level and one as
part of the definition of the `my_webhook` action.
