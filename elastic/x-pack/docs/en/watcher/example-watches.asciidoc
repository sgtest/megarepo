== Example Watches
The following examples show how to set up watches to:

* <<watch-cluster-status, Monitor the Status of an Elasticsearch Cluster>>
* <<watching-meetup-data, Monitor Event Data>>

For more example watches you can use as a starting point for building custom
watches, see the https://github.com/elastic/examples/tree/master/Alerting[Example
