=== Watches Are Not Updated When File Based Scripts Change

When you refer to a file script in a watch, the watch itself is not updated
if you change the script on the filesystem.

Currently, the only way to reload a file script in a watch is to delete 
the watch and recreate it.

=== Watcher UI

When you create a new watch or edit an existing watch, if you navigate away
from the page without saving your changes they will be lost without warning. 
Make sure to save your changes before leaving the page.

=== Security Integration

When {security} is enabled, a watch stores information about what the user who
stored the watch is allowed to execute **at that time**. This means, if those
permissions change over time, the watch will still be able to execute with the
permissions that existed when the watch was created.
