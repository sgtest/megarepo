== Encrypting Sensitive Data in {watcher}

Watches might have access to sensitive data such as HTTP basic authentication
information or details about your SMTP email service. You can encrypt this
data by generating a key and adding some secure settings on each node in your
cluster.

To encrypt sensitive data in {watcher}:

. Use the {ref}/syskeygen.html[elasticsearch-syskeygen] command to create a system key file.

. Copy the `system_key` file to all of the nodes in your cluster.
+
--
IMPORTANT: The system key is a symmetric key, so the same key must be used on
every node in the cluster.

--

. Set the
{ref}/notification-settings.html[`xpack.watcher.encrypt_sensitive_data` setting]:
+
--

[source,sh]
----------------------------------------------------------------
xpack.watcher.encrypt_sensitive_data: true
----------------------------------------------------------------
--

. Set the
{ref}/notification-settings.html[`xpack.watcher.encryption_key` setting] in the
{ref}/secure-settings.html[{es} keystore] on each node in the cluster.
+
--
For example, run the following command to import the `system_key` file on
each node:

[source,sh]
----------------------------------------------------------------
bin/elasticsearch-keystore add-file xpack.watcher.encryption_key <filepath>/system_key
----------------------------------------------------------------
--

. Delete the `system_key` file on each node in the cluster.

NOTE: Existing watches are not affected by these changes. Only watches that you
create after following these steps have encryption enabled.
