Machine Learning::
* The `max_running_jobs` node property is removed in this release. Use the
`xpack.ml.max_open_jobs` setting instead. For more information, <<ml-settings>>.

Security::
* The fields returned as part of the mappings section by get index, get
mappings, get field mappings and field capabilities API are now only the ones
that the user is authorized to access in case field level security is enabled.
