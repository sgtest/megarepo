== SQL CLI

Elasticsearch ships with a script to run the SQL CLI in its `bin` directory:

[source,bash]
--------------------------------------------------
$ ./bin/elasticsearch-sql-cli
--------------------------------------------------

The jar containing the SQL CLI is a stand alone Java application and
the scripts just launch it. You can move it around to other machines
without having to install Elasticsearch on them.

You can pass the URL of the Elasticsearch instance to connect to as
the first parameter:

[source,bash]
--------------------------------------------------
$ ./bin/elasticsearch-sql-cli https://some.server:9200
--------------------------------------------------

Once the CLI is running you can use any <<sql-spec,query>> that
Elasticsearch supports:

[source,sqlcli]
--------------------------------------------------
sql> SELECT * FROM library WHERE page_count > 500 ORDER BY page_count DESC;
     author      |        name        |  page_count   | release_date

[[sql-cli-permissions]]
[NOTE]
===============================
If you are using Security you need to add a few permissions to
users so they can run SQL. To run SQL using the CLI a user needs
`read`, `indices:admin/get`, and `cluster:monitor/main`. The
following example configures a role that can run SQL in the CLI
for the `test` and `bort` indices:

["source","yaml",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{sql-tests}/security/roles.yml[cli_jdbc]
--------------------------------------------------
