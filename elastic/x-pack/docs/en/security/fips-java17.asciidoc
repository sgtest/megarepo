{es} 8.0 requires Java 17 or later.  
There is not yet a FIPS-certified security module for Java 17 
that you can use when running {es} 8.0 in FIPS 140-2 mode.
If you run in FIPS 140-2 mode, you will either need to request
an exception from your security organization to upgrade to {es} 8.0, 
or remain on {es} 7.x until Java 17 is certified.
