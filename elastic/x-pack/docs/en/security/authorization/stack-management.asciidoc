[[stack-management]]
=== Granting access to Stack Management features
You <<defining-roles,define roles>> and set user privileges at different levels
to grant access to each of the Elastic Stack features.

[[stack-management-ccr]]
==== {ccr-cap}
The {ccr} user requires different cluster and index privileges on the remote
cluster and local cluster.

[[stack-management-ccr-remote]]
On the remote cluster that contains the leader index, the {ccr} user requires
`read_ccr` cluster privilege and `monitor` and `read` privileges on the
leader index.

[source,yml]
--------------------------------------------------
ccr_user:
  cluster:
    - read_ccr
  indices:
    - names: [ 'leader-index' ]
      privileges:
        - monitor
        - read
--------------------------------------------------

[[stack-management-ccr-local]]
On the local cluster that contains the follower index, the {ccr} user requires the `manage_ccr` cluster privilege and `monitor`, `read`, `write` and
`manage_follow_index` privileges on the follower index.

[source,yml]
--------------------------------------------------
ccr_user:
  cluster:
    - manage_ccr
  indices:
    - names: [ 'follower-index' ]
      privileges:
        - monitor
        - read
        - write
        - manage_follow_index
--------------------------------------------------

If you are managing
<<ccr-getting-started-remote-cluster,connecting to the remote cluster>> using
the cluster update settings API, you will also need a user with the `all`
cluster privilege.
