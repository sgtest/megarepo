=== Encrypting Communications in {es}

{security} enables you to encrypt traffic to, from, and within your {es} cluster.
Connections are secured using Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL).

WARNING: Clusters that do not have encryption enabled send all data in plain text
including passwords and will not be able to install a license that enables {security}.

To enable encryption, you need to perform the following steps on each node in
the cluster:

. Verify that the `xpack.security.enabled` setting is `true`. For more
information, see <<security-settings>>. 

. <<node-certificates, Generate a private key and X.509 certificate>>.

. Configure each node to:
.. Required: <<tls-transport,Enable TLS on the transport layer>>.
.. Recommended: <<tls-http,Enable TLS on the HTTP layer>>.

For more information about encrypting communications across the Elastic Stack,
see {xpack-ref}/encrypting-communications.html[Encrypting Communications].
