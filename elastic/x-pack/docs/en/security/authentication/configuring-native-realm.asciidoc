=== Configuring a native realm

The easiest way to manage and authenticate users is with the internal `native`
realm. 

The native realm is available by default when no other realms are 
configured. If other realm settings have been configured in `elasticsearch.yml`, 
you must add the native realm to the realm chain.

You can configure options for the `native` realm in the 
`xpack.security.authc.realms` namespace in `elasticsearch.yml`. Explicitly
configuring a native realm enables you to set the order in which it appears in
the realm chain, temporarily disable the realm, and control its cache options.

. Add a realm configuration of type `native` to `elasticsearch.yml` under the
`xpack.security.authc.realms` namespace. At a minimum, you must set the realm
`type` to `native`. If you are configuring multiple realms, you should also
explicitly set the `order` attribute.

See <<ref-native-settings>> for all of the options you can set for the `native` realm.
For example, the following snippet shows a `native` realm configuration that
sets the `order` to zero so the realm is checked first:

[source, yaml]
------------------------------------------------------------
xpack:
  security:
    authc:
      realms:
        native1:
          type: native
          order: 0
------------------------------------------------------------

. Manage your users in {kib} on the *Management / Security / Users* page. 
Alternatively, use the <<security-api-users,User Management APIs>>.
