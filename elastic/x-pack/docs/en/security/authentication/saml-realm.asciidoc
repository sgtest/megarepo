=== SAML authentication
{security} supports user authentication using SAML Single Sign On.
{security} provides this support using the Web Browser SSO profile of the SAML
2.0 protocol.

This protocol is specifically designed to support authentication via an
interactive web browser, so it does not operate as a standard authentication
realm. Instead, {security} provides features in {kib} and {es} that work
together to enable interactive SAML sessions.

This means that the SAML realm is not suitable for use by standard REST clients.
If you configure a SAML realm for use in {kib}, you should also configure
another realm, such as the <<native-realm, native realm>> in your authentication
chain.

In order to simplify the process of configuring SAML authentication within the
Elastic Stack, there is a step-by-step guide to
<<saml-guide, Configuring Elasticsearch and Kibana to use SAML Single-Sign-On>>.

The remainder of this document will describe {es} specific configuration options
for SAML realms.
