== User authentication

Authentication identifies an individual. To gain access to restricted resources,
a user must prove their identity, via passwords, credentials, or some other
means (typically referred to as authentication tokens).

The {stack} authenticates users by identifying the users behind the requests
that hit the cluster and verifying that they are who they claim to be. The
authentication process is handled by one or more authentication services called
<<realms,_realms_>>. 

You can use the native support for managing and authenticating users, or
integrate with external user management systems such as LDAP and Active
Directory. 

{security} provides built-in realms such as `native`,`ldap`, `active_directory`, 
`pki`, `file`, and `saml`. If none of the built-in realms meet your needs, you 
can also build your own custom realm and plug it into the {stack}. 

When {security} is enabled, depending on the realms you've configured, you must 
attach your user credentials to the requests sent to {es}. For example, when 
using realms that support usernames and passwords you can simply attach 
{wikipedia}/Basic_access_authentication[basic auth] header to the requests.
