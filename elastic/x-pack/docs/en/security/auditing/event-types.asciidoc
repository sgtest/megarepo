[[audit-event-types]]
=== Audit event types

When you are <<auditing,auditing security events>>, each request can generate 
multiple audit events. The following is a list of the events that can be generated:

|======
| `anonymous_access_denied`         | | | Logged when a request is denied due to a missing
                                          authentication token.
| `authentication_success`          | | | Logged when a user successfully authenticates.
| `authentication_failed`           | | | Logged when the authentication token cannot be
                                          matched to a known user.
| `realm_authentication_failed`     | | | Logged for every realm that fails to present a valid
                                          authentication token. `<realm>` represents the
                                          realm type.
| `access_denied`                   | | | Logged when an authenticated user attempts to execute
                                          an action they do not have the necessary
                                          <<security-reference, privilege>> to perform.
| `access_granted`                  | | | Logged when an authenticated user attempts to execute
                                          an action they have the necessary privilege to perform.
                                          When the `system_access_granted` event is included, all system
                                          (internal) actions are also logged. The default setting does
                                          not log system actions to avoid cluttering the logs.
| `run_as_granted`                  | | | Logged when an authenticated user attempts to <<run-as-privilege, run as>>
                                          another user that they have the necessary privileges to do.
| `run_as_denied`                   | | | Logged when an authenticated user attempts to <<run-as-privilege, run as>>
                                          another user action they do not have the necessary
                                          <<security-reference, privilege>> to do so.
| `tampered_request`                | | | Logged when {security} detects that the request has
                                          been tampered with. Typically relates to `search/scroll`
                                          requests when the scroll ID is believed to have been
                                          tampered with.
| `connection_granted`              | | | Logged when an incoming TCP connection passes the
                                          <<ip-filtering, IP Filter>> for a specific
                                          profile.
| `connection_denied`               | | | Logged when an incoming TCP connection does not pass the
                                          <<ip-filtering, IP Filter>> for a specific
                                          profile.
