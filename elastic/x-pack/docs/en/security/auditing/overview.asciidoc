== Auditing security events

You can enable auditing to keep track of security-related events such as
authentication failures and refused connections. Logging these events enables you
to monitor your cluster for suspicious activity and provides evidence in the
event of an attack.

[IMPORTANT]
============================================================================
Audit logs are **disabled** by default. To enable this functionality, you
must set `xpack.security.audit.enabled` to `true` in `elasticsearch.yml`.
============================================================================

The audit log persists events to a dedicated `<clustername>_audit.json` file on
the host's file system (on each node).
