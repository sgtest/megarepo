== Cross cluster search, clients, and integrations

When using {ref}/modules-cross-cluster-search.html[Cross Cluster Search]
you need to take extra steps to secure communications with the connected
clusters.

* <<cross-cluster-configuring, Cross Cluster Search and Security>>

You will need to update the configuration for several clients to work with a
secured cluster:

* <<java-clients, Java Clients>>
* <<http-clients, HTTP Clients>>


The {es} {security-features} enable you to secure your {es} cluster. But
{es} itself is only one product within the {stack}. It is often the case that
other products in the stack are connected to the cluster and therefore need to
be secured as well, or at least communicate with the cluster in a secured way:

* <<hadoop, Apache Hadoop>>
