. In a separate terminal from where {es} is running, navigate to the directory
where you installed {es} and run the
<<create-enrollment-token,`elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token`>> tool
to generate an enrollment token for your new nodes.
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----
bin{slash}elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s node
----
+
Copy the enrollment token, which you'll use to enroll new nodes with
your {es} cluster.

. From the installation directory of your new node, start {es} and pass the
enrollment token with the `--enrollment-token` parameter.
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----
bin{slash}elasticsearch --enrollment-token <enrollment-token>
----
+
{es} automatically generates certificates and keys in the following directory:
+
["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
----
config{slash}tls_auto_config_node_<timestamp>
----

. Repeat the previous step for any new nodes that you want to enroll.
