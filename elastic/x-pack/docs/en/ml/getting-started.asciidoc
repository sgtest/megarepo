== Getting Started with Machine Learning

Ready to get some hands-on experience with the {xpackml} features? This
tutorial shows you how to:

* Load a sample data set into {es}
* Create single and multi-metric {ml} jobs in {kib}
* Use the results to identify possible anomalies in the data

At the end of this tutorial, you should have a good idea of what {ml} is and
will hopefully be inspired to use it to detect anomalies in your own data.

You might also be interested in these video tutorials, which use the same sample
data:

=== System Overview

To follow the steps in this tutorial, you will need the following
components of the Elastic Stack:

* {es} {version}, which stores the data and the analysis results
* {kib} {version}, which provides a helpful user interface for creating and
viewing jobs

See the https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix[Elastic Support Matrix] for
information about supported operating systems.

See {stack-ref}/installing-elastic-stack.html[Installing the Elastic Stack] for
information about installing each of the components.

NOTE: To get started, you can install {es} and {kib} on a
single VM or even on your laptop (requires 64-bit OS).
As you add more data and your traffic grows,
you'll want to replace the single {es} instance with a cluster.

By default, when you install {es} and {kib}, {xpack} is installed and the 
{ml} features are enabled. You cannot use {ml} with the free basic license, but 
you can try all of the {xpack} features with a <<license-management,trial license>>. 

If you have multiple nodes in your cluster, you can optionally dedicate nodes to
specific purposes. If you want to control which nodes are
_machine learning nodes_ or limit which nodes run resource-intensive
activity related to jobs, see <<xpack-settings>>.

[[ml-gs-users]]
==== Users, Roles, and Privileges

The {xpackml} features implement cluster privileges and built-in roles to
make it easier to control which users have authority to view and manage the jobs,
{dfeeds}, and results.

By default, you can perform all of the steps in this tutorial by using the
built-in `elastic` super user. However, the password must be set before the user
can do anything. For information about how to set that password, see
<<security-getting-started>>.

If you are performing these steps in a production environment, take extra care
because `elastic` has the `superuser` role and you could inadvertently make
significant changes to the system. You can alternatively assign the
`machine_learning_admin` and `kibana_user` roles to a user ID of your choice.

For more information, see <<built-in-roles>> and <<privileges-list-cluster>>.
