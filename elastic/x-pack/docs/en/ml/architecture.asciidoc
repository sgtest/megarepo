=== Machine learning nodes

A {ml} node is a node that has `xpack.ml.enabled` and `node.ml` set to `true`,
which is the default behavior. If you set `node.ml` to `false`, the node can
service API requests but it cannot run jobs. If you want to use {xpackml}
features, there must be at least one {ml} node in your cluster. For more
information about this setting, see <<xpack-settings>>.
