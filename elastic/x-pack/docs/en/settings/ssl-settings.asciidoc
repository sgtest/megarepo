==== {component} TLS/SSL Settings
You can configure the following TLS/SSL settings. If the settings are not configured,
the {ref}/security-settings.html#ssl-tls-settings[Default TLS/SSL Settings]
are used.

ifdef::server[]
+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.enabled+::
Used to enable or disable TLS/SSL. The default is `false`.
endif::server[]

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.supported_protocols+::
Supported protocols with versions. Valid protocols: `SSLv2Hello`,
`SSLv3`, `TLSv1`, `TLSv1.1`, `TLSv1.2`. Defaults to `TLSv1.2`, `TLSv1.1`,
`TLSv1`. Defaults to the value of `xpack.ssl.supported_protocols`.

ifdef::server[]
+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.client_authentication+::
Controls the server's behavior in regard to requesting a certificate
from client connections. Valid values are `required`, `optional`, and `none`.
`required` forces a client to present a certificate, while `optional`
requests a client certificate but the client is not required to present one.
ifndef::client-auth-default[]
Defaults to the value of `xpack.ssl.client_authentication`.
endif::client-auth-default[]
ifdef::client-auth-default[]
Defaults to +{client-auth-default}+.
endif::client-auth-default[]
endif::server[]

ifdef::verifies[]
+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.verification_mode+::
Controls the verification of certificates. Valid values are `none`,
`certificate`, and `full`.
See <<ssl-tls-settings, `xpack.ssl.verification_mode`>> for a description of these values.
Defaults to the value of `xpack.ssl.verification_mode`.
endif::verifies[]

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.cipher_suites+::
Supported cipher suites can be found in Oracle's http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/SunProviders.html[
Java Cryptography Architecture documentation]. Defaults to the value of
`xpack.ssl.cipher_suites`.


===== {component} TLS/SSL Key and Trusted Certificate Settings

The following settings are used to specify a private key, certificate, and the
trusted certificates that should be used when communicating over an SSL/TLS connection.
If none of the settings below are specified, the {ref}/security-settings.html#ssl-tls-settings[Default TLS/SSL Settings] are used.
ifdef::server[]
A private key and certificate must be configured.
endif::server[]
ifndef::server[]
A private key and certificate are optional and would be used if the server requires client authentication for PKI
authentication.
endif::server[]
If none of the settings below are specified, the {ref}/security-settings.html#ssl-tls-settings[Default TLS/SSL Settings] are used.


===== PEM Encoded Files

When using PEM encoded files, use the following settings:

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.key+::
Path to a PEM encoded file containing the private key.

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.key_passphrase+::
The passphrase that is used to decrypt the private key. This value is optional
as the key might not be encrypted.

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.secure_key_passphrase+ (<<secure-settings,Secure>>)::
The passphrase that is used to decrypt the private key. This value is optional
as the key might not be encrypted.

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.certificate+::
Path to a PEM encoded file containing the certificate (or certificate chain)
that will be presented when requested.

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.certificate_authorities+::
List of paths to the PEM encoded certificate files that should be trusted.

===== Java Keystore Files

When using Java keystore files (JKS), which contain the private key, certificate
and certificates that should be trusted, use the following settings:

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.keystore.path+::
Path to the keystore that holds the private key and certificate.

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.keystore.password+::
Password to the keystore.

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.keystore.secure_password+ (<<secure-settings,Secure>>)::
Password to the keystore.

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.keystore.key_password+::
Password for the private key in the keystore. Defaults to the
same value as +{ssl-prefix}.ssl.keystore.password+.

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.keystore.secure_key_password+ (<<secure-settings,Secure>>)::
Password for the private key in the keystore.

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.truststore.path+::
Path to the truststore file.

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.truststore.password+::
Password to the truststore.

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.truststore.secure_password+ (<<secure-settings,Secure>>)::
Password to the truststore.

===== PKCS#12 Files

{security} can be configured to use PKCS#12 container files (`.p12` or `.pfx` files)
that contain the private key, certificate and certificates that should be trusted.

PKCS#12 files are configured in the same way as Java Keystore Files:

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.keystore.path+::
Path to the PKCS#12 file that holds the private key and certificate.

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.keystore.type+::
Set this to `PKCS12` to indicate that the keystore is a PKCS#12 file.

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.keystore.password+::
Password to the PKCS#12 file.

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.keystore.secure_password+ (<<secure-settings,Secure>>)::
Password to the PKCS#12 file.

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.keystore.key_password+::
Password for the private key stored in the PKCS#12 file.
Defaults to the same value as +{ssl-prefix}.ssl.keystore.password+.

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.keystore.secure_key_password+ (<<secure-settings,Secure>>)::
Password for the private key stored in the PKCS#12 file.

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.truststore.path+::
Path to the PKCS#12 file that holds the certificates to be trusted.

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.truststore.type+::
Set this to `PKCS12` to indicate that the truststore is a PKCS#12 file.

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.truststore.password+::
Password to the PKCS#12 file.

+{ssl-prefix}.ssl.truststore.secure_password+ (<<secure-settings,Secure>>)::
Password to the PKCS#12 file.
