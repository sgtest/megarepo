= Rolling up historical data

Keeping historical data around for analysis is extremely useful but often avoided due to the financial cost of
archiving massive amounts of data.  Retention periods are thus driven by financial realities rather than by the
usefulness of extensive historical data.

The Rollup feature in {xpack} provides a means to summarize and store historical data so that it can still be used
for analysis, but at a fraction of the storage cost of raw data.
