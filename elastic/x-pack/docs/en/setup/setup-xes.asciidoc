{xpack} is an Elastic Stack extension that provides security, alerting,
monitoring, reporting, machine learning, and many other capabilities. By default, 
when you install {es}, {xpack} is installed. 
 	 
If you want to try all of the {xpack} features, you can 
{xpack-ref}/license-management.html[start a 30-day trial]. At the end of the 
trial period, you can purchase a subscription to keep using the full 
functionality of the {xpack} components. For more information, see 
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions.
