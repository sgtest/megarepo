=== Delete token API

Invalidates a bearer token for access without requiring basic authentication.

==== Request

`DELETE /_xpack/security/oauth2/token`

==== Description

The tokens returned by the <<security-api-get-token,get token API>> have a 
finite period of time for which they are valid and after that time period, they 
can no longer be used. That time period is defined by the 
`xpack.security.authc.token.timeout` setting. For more information, see 
<<token-service-settings>>.

If you want to invalidate a token immediately, use this delete token API.


==== Request Body

The following parameters can be specified in the body of a DELETE request and
pertain to deleting a token:

`token` (required)::
(string) An access token.

==== Examples

The following example invalidates the specified token immediately:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
DELETE /_xpack/security/oauth2/token
{
  "token" : "dGhpcyBpcyBub3QgYSByZWFsIHRva2VuIGJ1dCBpdCBpcyBvbmx5IHRlc3QgZGF0YS4gZG8gbm90IHRyeSB0byByZWFkIHRva2VuIQ=="
}
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE

A successful call returns a JSON structure that indicates whether the token
has already been invalidated.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "created" : true <1>
}
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE
