[[security-api-has-privileges-user-profile]]

beta::[]

Determines whether the users associated with the specified <<user-profile, user profile>> IDs
have all the requested privileges.

[[security-api-has-privileges-user-profile-request]]
==== {api-request-title}

`GET /_security/profile/_has_privileges`

`POST /_security/profile/_has_privileges`

[[security-api-has-privileges-user-profile-prereqs]]
==== {api-prereq-title}

To use this API, you must have the `manage_user_profile` cluster privilege.

[[security-api-has-privileges-user-profile-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

This API uses the profile IDs, as returned by <<security-api-activate-user-profile>>,
to identify the users for which to check the privileges of.
It is similar to the <<security-api-has-privileges>> API, but unlike it, this API
checks the privileges of other users, not of the user that's calling it.

See <<security-privileges>> for the list of privileges that can be specified in this API.

A successful call returns the subset list of profile IDs that have **all** the requested privileges.

[[security-api-has-privileges-user-profile-request-body]]
==== {api-request-body-title}

`uids`:: (list) A list of <<security-api-activate-user-profile-response-body, profile IDs>>. The privileges are checked for associated users of the profiles.

`privileges`:: The object containing all the privileges to be checked.
`cluster`::: (list) A list of the cluster privileges that you want to check.
`index`:::
`names`:::: (list) A list of indices.
`allow_restricted_indices`:::: (Boolean) This needs to be set to `true` (default
is `false`) if using wildcards or regexps for patterns that cover restricted
indices. Implicitly, restricted indices do not match index patterns because
restricted indices usually have limited privileges and including them in
pattern tests would render most such tests `false`. If restricted indices are
explicitly included in the `names` list, privileges will be checked against
them regardless of the value of `allow_restricted_indices`.
`privileges`:::: (list) A list of the privileges that you want to check for the
specified indices.
`application`:::
`application`:::: (string) The name of the application.
`privileges`:::: (list) A list of the privileges that you want to check for the
specified resources. May be either application privilege names, or the names of
actions that are granted by those privileges.
`resources`:::: (list) A list of resource names against which the privileges
should be checked.

Note that the `privileges` section above is identical to the
<<security-api-has-privileges-request-body, request body of the other Has Privileges API>>.

[[security-api-has-privileges-user-profile-response-body]]
==== {api-response-body-title}

A successful has privileges user profile API call returns a JSON structure that contains
two list fields:

`has_privilege_uids`:: (list) The subset of the requested profile IDs of the users that have
**all** the requested privileges.

`error_uids`:: (list) The subset of the requested profile IDs for which an error was
encountered. It does **not** include the missing profile IDs or the profile IDs of
the users that do not have all the requested privileges. This field is absent if empty.

[[security-api-has-privileges-user-profile-example]]
==== {api-examples-title}

The following example checks whether the two users associated with the specified profiles have all the
requested set of cluster, index, and application privileges:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
POST /_security/user/_has_privileges
{
  "uids": ["u_LQPnxDxEjIH0GOUoFkZr5Y57YUwSkL9Joiq-g4OCbPc_0", "u_rzRnxDgEHIH0GOUoFkZr5Y27YUwSk19Joiq=g4OCxxB_1"],
  "cluster": [ "monitor", "create_snapshot", "manage_ml" ],
  "index" : [
    {
      "names": [ "suppliers", "products" ],
      "privileges": [ "create_doc"]
    },
    {
      "names": [ "inventory" ],
      "privileges" : [ "read", "write" ]
    }
  ],
  "application": [
    {
      "application": "inventory_manager",
      "privileges" : [ "read", "data:write/inventory" ],
      "resources" : [ "product/1852563" ]
    }
  ]
}
--------------------------------------------------
// TEST[skip:TODO setup and tests will be possible once the profile uid is predictable]

The following example output indicates that only one of the two users has all the privileges:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "has_privilege_uids": ["u_rzRnxDgEHIH0GOUoFkZr5Y27YUwSk19Joiq=g4OCxxB_1"]
}
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE
