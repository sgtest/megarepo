=== Enroll Node API
++++
<titleabbrev>Enroll Node</titleabbrev>
++++

Allows a new node to join an existing cluster with security features enabled.

[[security-api-node-enrollment-api-request]]
==== {api-request-title}

`GET /_security/enroll/node`

[[security-api-node-enrollment-api-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

The purpose of the enroll node API is to allow a new node to join an existing cluster
where security is enabled. The enroll node API response contains all the necessary information
for the joining node to bootstrap discovery and security related settings so that it
can successfully join the cluster.

NOTE: The response contains key and certificate material that allows the
caller to generate valid signed certificates for the HTTP layer of all nodes in the cluster.

<5> A list of transport addresses in the form of `host:port` for the nodes that are already
    members of the cluster.
