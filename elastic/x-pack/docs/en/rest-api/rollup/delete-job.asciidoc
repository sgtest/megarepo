to delete a non-existing job will throw an exception

`job_id` (required)::
  (string) Identifier for the job

==== Examples

If we have a rollup job named `sensor`, it can be deleted with:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
DELETE _xpack/rollup/job/sensor
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[setup:sensor_rollup_job]

Which will return the response:

[source,js]
----
{
  "acknowledged": true
}
----
// TESTRESPONSE

If however we try to delete a job which doesn't exist:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
DELETE _xpack/rollup/job/does_not_exist
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[catch:missing]

A 404 `resource_not_found` exception will be thrown:

[source,js]
----
{
    "error" : {
        "root_cause" : [
            {
                "type" : "resource_not_found_exception",
                "reason" : "the task with id does_not_exist doesn't exist",
                "stack_trace": ...
            }
        ],
        "type" : "resource_not_found_exception",
        "reason" : "the task with id does_not_exist doesn't exist",
        "stack_trace": ...
    },
    "status": 404
}
----
// TESTRESPONSE[s/"stack_trace": .../"stack_trace": $body.$_path/]
