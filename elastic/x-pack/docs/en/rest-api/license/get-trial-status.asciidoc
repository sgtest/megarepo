=== Get Trial Status API

This API enables you to check the status of your trial license.

[float]
==== Request

`GET _xpack/license/trial_status`

[float]
==== Description

If a license is not already registered for the cluster, one is generated when
the nodes start. By default, this is a 30-day trial license that gives access
to all {xpack} features.

NOTE: You are allowed to initiate a trial license only if your cluster has not
already activated a trial license for the current major X-Pack version. For
example, if you have already activated a trial for v6.0, you cannot start a new
trial until v7.0. You can, however, contact `info@elastic.co` to request an
extended trial license.

For more information about the different types of licenses, see
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions.

==== Authorization

You must have `monitor` cluster privileges to use this API.
For more information, see
{xpack-ref}/security-privileges.html[Security Privileges].
