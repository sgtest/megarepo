/**
 * A driver-local context that is shared across operators.
 *
 * Operators in the same driver pipeline are executed in a single threaded fashion. A driver context
 * has a set of mutating methods that can be used to store and share values across these operators,
 * or even outside the Driver. When the Driver is finished, it finishes the context. Finishing the
 * context effectively takes a snapshot of the driver context values so that they can be exposed
 * outside the Driver. The net result of this is that the driver context can be mutated freely,
 * without contention, by the thread executing the pipeline of operators until it is finished.
 * The context must be finished by the thread running the Driver, when the Driver is finished.
 *
 * Releasables can be added and removed to the context by operators in the same driver pipeline.
 * This allows to "transfer ownership" of a shared resource across operators (and even across
 * Drivers), while ensuring that the resource can be correctly released when no longer needed.
 *
 * Currently only supports releasables, but additional driver-local context can be added.
