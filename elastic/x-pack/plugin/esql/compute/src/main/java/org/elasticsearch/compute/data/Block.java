/**
 * A Block is a columnar representation of homogenous data. It has a position (row) count, and
 * various data retrieval methods for accessing the underlying data that is stored at a given
 * position.
 *
 * <p> Blocks can represent various shapes of underlying data. A Block can represent either sparse
 * or dense data. A Block can represent either single or multi valued data. A Block that represents
 * dense single-valued data can be viewed as a {@link Vector}.
 *
 * TODO: update comment
 * <p> All Blocks share the same set of data retrieval methods, but actual concrete implementations
 * effectively support a subset of these, throwing {@code UnsupportedOperationException} where a
 * particular data retrieval method is not supported. For example, a Block of primitive longs may
 * not support retrieval as an integer, {code getInt}. This greatly simplifies Block usage and
 * avoids cumbersome use-site casting.
 *
 * <p> Block are immutable and can be passed between threads.
