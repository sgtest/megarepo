/**
 * Implement an evaluator for a function reducing multivalued fields into a
 * single valued field from a static {@code process} method.
 * <p>
 *     Annotated methods can have two "shapes": pairwise processing and
 *     accumulator processing. Pairwise is <strong>generally</strong>
 *     simpler and looks like {@code int process(int current, int next)}.
 *     Use it when the result is a primitive. Accumulator processing is
 *     a bit more complex and looks like {@code void process(State state, int v)}
 *     and it useful when you need to accumulate more data than fits
 *     in a primitive result. Think Kahan summation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Both method shapes support at {@code finish = "finish_method"} parameter
 *     on the annotation which is used to, well, "finish" processing after
 *     all values have been received. Again, think reading the sum from the
 *     Kahan summation. Or doing the division for an "average" operation.
 *     This method is required for accumulator processing.
