/**
 * A {@code ChainingInputStream} concatenates multiple component input streams into a
 * single input stream.
 * It starts reading from the first input stream until it's exhausted, whereupon
 * it closes it and starts reading from the next one, until the last component input
 * stream is exhausted.
 * <p>
 * The implementing subclass provides the component input streams by implementing the
 * {@link #nextComponent(InputStream)} method. This method receives the instance of the
 * current input stream, which has been exhausted, and must return the next input stream,
 * or {@code null} if there are no more component streams.
 * The {@code ChainingInputStream} assumes ownership of the newly generated component input
 * stream, i.e. components should not be used by other callers and they will be closed
 * when they are exhausted or when the {@code ChainingInputStream} is closed.
 * <p>
 * This stream does support {@code mark} and {@code reset} but it expects that the component
 * streams also support it. When {@code mark} is invoked on the chaining input stream, the
 * call is forwarded to the current input stream component and a reference to that component
 * is stored internally. A {@code reset} invocation on the chaining input stream will then make the
 * stored component the current component and will then call the {@code reset} on it.
 * The {@link #nextComponent(InputStream)} method must be able to generate the same components
 * anew, starting from the component of the {@code reset} call.
 * If the component input streams do not support {@code mark}/{@code reset} or
 * {@link #nextComponent(InputStream)} cannot generate the same component multiple times,
 * the implementing subclass must override {@link #markSupported()} to return {@code false}.
 * <p>
 * The {@code close} call will close the current component input stream and any subsequent {@code read},
 * {@code skip}, {@code available} and {@code reset} calls will throw {@code IOException}s.
 * <p>
 * The {@code ChainingInputStream} is similar in purpose to the {@link java.io.SequenceInputStream},
 * with the addition of {@code mark}/{@code reset} support.
 * <p>
 * This is NOT thread-safe, multiple threads sharing a single instance must synchronize access.
