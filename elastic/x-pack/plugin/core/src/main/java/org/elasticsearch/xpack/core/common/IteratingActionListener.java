/**
 * This action listener wraps another listener and provides a framework for iteration over a List while calling an asynchronous function
 * for each. The listener calls the {@link BiConsumer} with the current element in the list and a {@link ActionListener}. This function
 * is expected to call the listener in case of success or failure due to an exception. If there is a failure due to an exception the wrapped
 * listener's {@link ActionListener#onFailure(Exception)} method is called. If the consumer calls {@link #onResponse(Object)} with a
 * non-null object, iteration will cease and the wrapped listener will be called with the response. In the case of a null value being passed
 * to {@link #onResponse(Object)} then iteration will continue by applying the {@link BiConsumer} to the next item in the list; if the list
 * has no more elements then the wrapped listener will be called with a null value, unless an optional {@link Supplier} is provided
 * that supplies the response to send for {@link ActionListener#onResponse(Object)}.
 *
 * After creation, iteration is started by calling {@link #run()}
