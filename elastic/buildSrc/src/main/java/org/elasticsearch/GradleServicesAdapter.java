/**
 * Facilitate access to Gradle services without a direct dependency on Project.
 *
 * In a future release Gradle will offer service injection, this adapter plays that role until that time.
 * It exposes the service methods that are part of the public API as the classes implementing them are not.
 * Today service injection is <a href="https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/2363">not available</a> for
 * extensions.
 *
 * Everything exposed here must be thread safe. That is the very reason why project is not passed in directly.
