=== Breaking Changes

<<write-thread-pool-fallback, Removed `thread_pool.bulk.*` settings and
`es.thread_pool.write.use_bulk_as_display_name` system property>> ({pull}29609[#29609])

<<remove-suggest-metric, Removed `suggest` metric on stats APIs>> ({pull}29635[#29635])

<<remove-field-caps-body, In field capabilities APIs, removed support for providing fields in the request body>> ({pull}30185[#30185])

Machine Learning::
* The `max_running_jobs` node property is removed in this release. Use the
`xpack.ml.max_open_jobs` setting instead. For more information, see <<ml-settings>>.

Monitoring::
* The `xpack.monitoring.collection.interval` setting can no longer be set to `-1`
to disable monitoring data collection. Use `xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled`
and set it to `false` (its default), which was added in 6.3.0.

Security::
* The fields returned as part of the mappings section by get index, get
mappings, get field mappings, and field capabilities API are now only the
ones that the user is authorized to access in case field level security is enabled.
