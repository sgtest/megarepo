=== Breaking Changes

<<write-thread-pool-fallback, Removed `thread_pool.bulk.*` settings and
`es.thread_pool.write.use_bulk_as_display_name` system property>> ({pull}29609[#29609])

<<systemd-service-file-config, Systemd service file is no longer marked as configuration>> ({pull}29004[#29004])
<<remove-suggest-metric, Removed `suggest` metric on stats APIs>> ({pull}29635[#29635])

<<remove-field-caps-body, In field capabilities APIs, removed support for providing fields in the request body>> ({pull}30185[#30185])

Machine Learning::
* The `max_running_jobs` node property is removed in this release. Use the
`xpack.ml.max_open_jobs` setting instead. For more information, see <<ml-settings>>.

* <<remove-http-enabled, Removed `http.enabled` setting>> ({pull}29601[#29601])

//[float]
//=== Breaking Java Changes

[float]
=== Deprecations
Monitoring::
* The `xpack.monitoring.collection.interval` setting can no longer be set to `-1`
to disable monitoring data collection. Use `xpack.monitoring.collection.enabled`
and set it to `false` (its default), which was added in 6.3.0.

Security::
* The fields returned as part of the mappings section by get index, get
mappings, get field mappings, and field capabilities API are now only the
ones that the user is authorized to access in case field level security is enabled.

=== Bug Fixes

Fixed prerelease version of elasticsearch in the `deb` package to sort before GA versions
({pull}29000[#29000])

Rollup::
* Validate timezone in range queries to ensure they match the selected job when
searching ({pull}30338[#30338])

[float]
=== Regressions
Fail snapshot operations early when creating or deleting a snapshot on a repository that has been
written to by an older Elasticsearch after writing to it with a newer Elasticsearch version. ({pull}30140[#30140])

Fix NPE when CumulativeSum agg encounters null value/empty bucket ({pull}29641[#29641])
Do not fail snapshot when deleting a missing snapshotted file ({pull}30332[#30332])

=== New Features

The new <<mapping-ignored-field,`_ignored`>> field allows to know which fields
got ignored at index time because of the <<ignore-malformed,`ignore_malformed`>>
option. ({pull}30140[#29658])

A new analysis plugin called `analysis_nori` that exposes the Lucene Korean
analysis module.  ({pull}30397[#30397])

[float]
=== Enhancements

{ref-64}/breaking_64_api_changes.html#copy-source-settings-on-resize[Allow copying source settings on index resize operations] ({pull}30255[#30255])

Added new "Request" object flavored request methods. Prefer these instead of the
multi-argument versions. ({pull}29623[#29623])

The cluster state listener to decide if watcher should be
stopped/started/paused now runs far less code in an executor but is more
synchronous and predictable. Also the trigger engine thread is only started on
data nodes. And the Execute Watch API can be triggered regardless is watcher is
started or stopped. ({pull}30118[#30118])

Added put index template API to the high level rest client ({pull}30400[#30400])

[float]
=== Bug Fixes

Do not ignore request analysis/similarity settings on index resize operations when the source index already contains such settings ({pull}30216[#30216])

Fix NPE when CumulativeSum agg encounters null value/empty bucket ({pull}29641[#29641])

Machine Learning::

* Account for gaps in data counts after job is reopened ({pull}30294[#30294])

Add validation that geohashes are not empty and don't contain unsupported characters ({pull}30376[#30376])

Rollup::
* Validate timezone in range queries to ensure they match the selected job when
searching ({pull}30338[#30338])


Allocation::

Auto-expand replicas when adding or removing nodes to prevent shard copies from
being dropped and resynced when a data node rejoins the cluster ({pull}30423[#30423])
