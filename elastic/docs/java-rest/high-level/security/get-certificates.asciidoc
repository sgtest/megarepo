=== SSL Certificate API

[[java-rest-high-security-get-certificates-execution]]
==== Execution

The X.509 Certificates that are used to encrypt communications in an
Elasticsearch cluster using the `security().getSslCertificates()` method:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/SecurityDocumentationIT.java[get-certificates-execute]
--------------------------------------------------

[[java-rest-high-security-get-certificates-response]]
==== Response

The returned `GetSslCertificatesResponse` contains a single field, `certificates`.
This field, accessed with `getCertificates` returns a List of `CertificateInfo`
objects containing the information for all the certificates used.

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/SecurityDocumentationIT.java[get-certificates-response]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> `certificates` is a List of `CertificateInfo`

[[java-rest-high-security-get-certificates-execute-async]]
==== Asynchronous Execution

This request can be executed asynchronously using the `security().getSslCertificatesAsync()`
method:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/SecurityDocumentationIT.java[get-certificates-execute-async]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The `ActionListener` to use when the execution completes.

The asynchronous method does not block and returns immediately. Once the request
has completed the `ActionListener` is called back using the `onResponse` method
if the execution successfully completed or using the `onFailure` method if
it failed.

A typical listener for a `GetSslCertificatesResponse` looks like:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/SecurityDocumentationIT.java[get-certificates-execute-listener]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Called when the execution is successfully completed. The response is
provided as an argument.
<2> Called in case of failure. The raised exception is provided as an argument.
