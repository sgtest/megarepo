=== Refresh API

[[java-rest-high-refresh-request]]
==== Refresh Request

A `RefreshRequest` can be applied to one or more indices, or even on `_all` the indices:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IndicesClientDocumentationIT.java[refresh-request]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Refresh one index
<2> Refresh multiple indices
<3> Refresh all the indices

==== Optional arguments

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IndicesClientDocumentationIT.java[refresh-request-indicesOptions]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Setting `IndicesOptions` controls how unavailable indices are resolved and
how wildcard expressions are expanded

[[java-rest-high-refresh-sync]]
==== Synchronous Execution

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IndicesClientDocumentationIT.java[refresh-execute]
--------------------------------------------------

[[java-rest-high-refresh-async]]
==== Asynchronous Execution

The asynchronous execution of a refresh request requires both the `RefreshRequest`
instance and an `ActionListener` instance to be passed to the asynchronous
method:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IndicesClientDocumentationIT.java[refresh-execute-async]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The `RefreshRequest` to execute and the `ActionListener` to use when
the execution completes

The asynchronous method does not block and returns immediately. Once it is
completed the `ActionListener` is called back using the `onResponse` method
if the execution successfully completed or using the `onFailure` method if
it failed.

A typical listener for `RefreshResponse` looks like:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IndicesClientDocumentationIT.java[refresh-execute-listener]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Called when the execution is successfully completed. The response is
provided as an argument
<2> Called in case of failure. The raised exception is provided as an argument

[[java-rest-high-refresh-response]]
==== Refresh Response

The returned `RefreshResponse` allows to retrieve information about the
executed operation as follows:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IndicesClientDocumentationIT.java[refresh-response]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Total number of shards hit by the refresh request
<2> Number of shards where the refresh has succeeded
<3> Number of shards where the refresh has failed
<4> A list of failures if the operation failed on one or more shards

By default, if the indices were not found, an `ElasticsearchException` will be thrown:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IndicesClientDocumentationIT.java[refresh-notfound]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Do something if the indices to be refreshed were not found
