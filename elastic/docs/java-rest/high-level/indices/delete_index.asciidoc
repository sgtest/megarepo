=== Delete Index API

[[java-rest-high-delete-index-request]]
==== Delete Index Request

A `DeleteIndexRequest` requires an `index` argument:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IndicesClientDocumentationIT.java[delete-index-request]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Index

==== Optional arguments
The following arguments can optionally be provided:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IndicesClientDocumentationIT.java[delete-index-request-timeout]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Timeout to wait for the all the nodes to acknowledge the index deletion as a `TimeValue`
<2> Timeout to wait for the all the nodes to acknowledge the index deletion as a `String`

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IndicesClientDocumentationIT.java[delete-index-request-masterTimeout]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Timeout to connect to the master node as a `TimeValue`
<2> Timeout to connect to the master node as a `String`

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IndicesClientDocumentationIT.java[delete-index-request-indicesOptions]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Setting `IndicesOptions` controls how unavailable indices are resolved and
how wildcard expressions are expanded

[[java-rest-high-delete-index-sync]]
==== Synchronous Execution

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IndicesClientDocumentationIT.java[delete-index-execute]
--------------------------------------------------

[[java-rest-high-delete-index-async]]
==== Asynchronous Execution

The asynchronous execution of a delete index request requires both the `DeleteIndexRequest`
instance and an `ActionListener` instance to be passed to the asynchronous
method:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IndicesClientDocumentationIT.java[delete-index-execute-async]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The `DeleteIndexRequest` to execute and the `ActionListener` to use when
the execution completes

The asynchronous method does not block and returns immediately. Once it is
completed the `ActionListener` is called back using the `onResponse` method
if the execution successfully completed or using the `onFailure` method if
it failed.

A typical listener for `DeleteIndexResponse` looks like:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IndicesClientDocumentationIT.java[delete-index-execute-listener]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Called when the execution is successfully completed. The response is
provided as an argument
<2> Called in case of failure. The raised exception is provided as an argument

[[java-rest-high-delete-index-response]]
==== Delete Index Response

The returned `DeleteIndexResponse` allows to retrieve information about the executed
 operation as follows:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IndicesClientDocumentationIT.java[delete-index-response]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Indicates whether all of the nodes have acknowledged the request

If the index was not found, an `ElasticsearchException` will be thrown:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/IndicesClientDocumentationIT.java[delete-index-notfound]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Do something if the index to be deleted was not found
