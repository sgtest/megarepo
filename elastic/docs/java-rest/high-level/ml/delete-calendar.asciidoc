=== Delete Calendar API
Delete a {ml} calendar.
The API accepts a `DeleteCalendarRequest` and responds
with a `AcknowledgedResponse` object.

[[java-rest-high-x-pack-ml-delete-calendar-request]]
==== Delete Calendar Request

A `DeleteCalendar` object requires a non-null `calendarId`.

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
---------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/MlClientDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-ml-delete-calendar-request]
---------------------------------------------------
<1> Constructing a new request referencing an existing Calendar

[[java-rest-high-x-pack-ml-delete-calendar-response]]
==== Delete Calendar Response

The returned `AcknowledgedResponse` object indicates the acknowledgement of the request:

---------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/MlClientDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-ml-delete-calendar-response]
---------------------------------------------------
<1> `isAcknowledged` was the deletion request acknowledged or not

[[java-rest-high-x-pack-ml-delete-calendar-execution]]
==== Execution
The request can be executed through the `MachineLearningClient` contained
in the `RestHighLevelClient` object, accessed via the `machineLearningClient()` method.

[[java-rest-high-x-pack-ml-delete-calendar-async]]
==== Delete Calendar Asynchronously

This request can also be made asynchronously.
["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
---------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/MlClientDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-ml-delete-calendar-execute-async]
---------------------------------------------------
<1> The `DeleteCalendarRequest` to execute and the `ActionListener` to alert on completion or error.

The deletion request returns immediately. Once the request is completed, the `ActionListener` is
called back using the `onResponse` or `onFailure`. The latter indicates some failure occurred when
making the request.

A typical listener for a `DeleteCalendarRequest` could be defined as follows:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
---------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/MlClientDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-ml-delete-calendar-listener]
---------------------------------------------------
<1> The action to be taken when it is completed
<2> What to do when a failure occurs
