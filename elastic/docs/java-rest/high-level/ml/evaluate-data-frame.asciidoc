=== Evaluate {dfanalytics} API

Evaluates the {ml} algorithm that ran on a {dataframe}.
The API accepts an +{request}+ object and returns an +{response}+.

<1> Constructing a new evaluation request
<2> Reference to an existing index
<3> The query with which to select data from indices
<4> Kind of evaluation to perform
<5> Name of the field in the index. Its value denotes the actual (i.e. ground truth) label for an example. Must be either true or false
<6> Name of the field in the index. Its value denotes the probability (as per some ML algorithm) of the example being classified as positive
<7> The remaining parameters are the metrics to be calculated based on the two fields described above.
