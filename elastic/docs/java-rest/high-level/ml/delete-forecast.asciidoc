=== Delete Forecast API

The Delete Forecast API provides the ability to delete a {ml} job's
forecast in the cluster.
It accepts a `DeleteForecastRequest` object and responds
with an `AcknowledgedResponse` object.

[[java-rest-high-x-pack-ml-delete-forecast-request]]
==== Delete Forecast Request

A `DeleteForecastRequest` object gets created with an existing non-null `jobId`.
All other fields are optional for the request.

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/MlClientDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-ml-delete-forecast-request]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Constructing a new request referencing an existing `jobId`

==== Optional Arguments

The following arguments are optional.

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/MlClientDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-ml-delete-forecast-request-options]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Sets the specific forecastIds to delete, can be set to `_all` to indicate ALL forecasts for the given
`jobId` 
<2> Set the timeout for the request to respond, default is 30 seconds 
<3> Set the `allow_no_forecasts` option. When `true` no error will be returned if an `_all`
request finds no forecasts. It defaults to `true` 

[[java-rest-high-x-pack-ml-delete-forecast-execution]]
==== Execution

The request can be executed through the `MachineLearningClient` contained
in the `RestHighLevelClient` object, accessed via the `machineLearningClient()` method.

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/MlClientDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-ml-delete-forecast-execute]
--------------------------------------------------

[[java-rest-high-x-pack-ml-delete-forecast-execution-async]]
==== Asynchronous Execution

The request can also be executed asynchronously:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/MlClientDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-ml-delete-forecast-execute-async]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The `DeleteForecastRequest` to execute and the `ActionListener` to use when
the execution completes

The method does not block and returns immediately. The passed `ActionListener` is used
to notify the caller of completion. A typical `ActionListener` for `AcknowledgedResponse` may
look like

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/MlClientDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-ml-delete-forecast-listener]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> `onResponse` is called back when the action is completed successfully
<2> `onFailure` is called back when some unexpected error occurs

[[java-rest-high-x-pack-ml-delete-forecast-response]]
==== Delete Forecast Response

An `AcknowledgedResponse` contains an acknowledgement of the forecast(s) deletion

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests}/MlClientDocumentationIT.java[x-pack-ml-delete-forecast-response]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> `isAcknowledged()` indicates if the forecast was successfully deleted or not.
