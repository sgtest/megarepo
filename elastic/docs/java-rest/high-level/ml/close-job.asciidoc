=== Close Job API

The Close Job API provides the ability to close {ml} jobs in the cluster.
It accepts a +{request}+ object and responds
with a +{response}+ object.

[id="{upid}-{api}-request"]
==== Close Job Request

A +{request}+ object gets created with an existing non-null `jobId`.

 (This includes `_all` string or when no jobs have been specified)
<4> Optionally setting the `timeout` value for how long the
execution should wait for the job to be closed.
