=== Get trained models API

experimental[]

Retrieves one or more trained models.
The API accepts a +{request}+ object and returns a +{response}+.

[id="{upid}-{api}-request"]
==== Get trained models request

A +{request}+ requires either a trained model ID, a comma-separated list of
IDs, or the special wildcard `_all` to get all trained models.

--------------------------------------------------
<1> Constructing a new GET request referencing an existing trained model
<2> Set the paging parameters
<3> Indicate if the complete model definition should be included
<4> Indicate if the total feature importance for the features used in training
    should be included in the model `metadata` field.
<5> Should the definition be fully decompressed on GET
<6> Allow empty response if no trained models match the provided ID patterns.
    If false, an error will be thrown if no trained models match the
    ID patterns.
<7> An optional list of tags used to narrow the model search. A trained model
    can have many tags or none. The trained models in the response will
    contain all the provided tags.
<8> Optional boolean value for requesting the trained model in a format that can
    then be put into another cluster. Certain fields that can only be set when
    the model is imported are removed.
