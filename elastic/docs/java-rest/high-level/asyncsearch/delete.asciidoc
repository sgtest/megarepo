=== Delete Async Search API

[id="{upid}-{api}-request"]
==== Request

A +{request}+ allows deleting a running asynchronous search task using
its id. Required arguments are the `id` of a running search:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests-file}[{api}-request]
--------------------------------------------------

[id="{upid}-{api}-sync"]
==== Synchronous Execution

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests-file}[{api}-execute]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Execute the request and get back the response as an +{response}+ object.

[id="{upid}-{api}-async"]
==== Asynchronous Execution

The asynchronous execution of a +{request}+ allows to use an 
`ActionListener` to be called back when the submit request returns: 

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests-file}[{api}-execute-async]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> The +{request}+ to execute and the `ActionListener` to use when
the execution completes

The asynchronous method does not block and returns immediately. Once it is
completed the `ActionListener` is called back using the `onResponse` method
if the execution successfully completed or using the `onFailure` method if
it failed.

A typical listener for +{response}+ looks like:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests-file}[{api}-listener]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Called when the execution is successfully completed. The response is
provided as an argument
<2> Called in case of failure. The raised exception is provided as an argument

[id="{upid}-{api}-response"]
==== Response

The returned +{response}+ indicates the acknowledgement of the request:

["source","java",subs="attributes,callouts,macros"]
--------------------------------------------------
include-tagged::{doc-tests-file}[{api}-response]
--------------------------------------------------
<1> `isAcknowledged` was the deletion request acknowledged or not.
