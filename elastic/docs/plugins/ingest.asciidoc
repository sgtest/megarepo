=== Core Ingest Plugins

The core ingest plugins are:

<<ingest-attachment>>::

The ingest attachment plugin lets Elasticsearch extract file attachments in common formats (such as PPT, XLS, and PDF) by
using the Apache text extraction library http://lucene.apache.org/tika/[Tika].

<<ingest-geoip>>::

The GeoIP processor adds information about the geographical location of IP addresses, based on data from the Maxmind databases.
This processor adds this information by default under the `geoip` field.
+
The ingest-geoip plugin ships by default with the GeoLite2 City and GeoLite2 Country geoip2 databases from Maxmind made available
under the CCA-ShareAlike 3.0 license. For more details see, http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/.

<<ingest-user-agent>>::

A processor that extracts details from the User-Agent header value.
