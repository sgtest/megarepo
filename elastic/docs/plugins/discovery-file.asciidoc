[[discovery-file]]
=== File-Based Discovery Plugin

The functionality provided by the `discovery-file` plugin is now available in
Elasticsearch without requiring a plugin. This plugin still exists to ensure
backwards compatibility, but it will be removed in a future version.

On installation, this plugin creates a file at
`$ES_PATH_CONF/discovery-file/unicast_hosts.txt` that comprises comments that
describe how to use it. It is preferable not to install this plugin and instead
to create this file, and its containing directory, using standard tools.
