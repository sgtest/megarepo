== Overview

An official Go client for Elasticsearch.

Full documentation is hosted at https://github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch[GitHub]
and https://godoc.org/github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch[GoDoc]
-- this page provides only an overview.

.Work In Progress
************************************************************************************
The client is currently available as a public preview. We encourage you to try the
package in your projects, but please be aware that the public API may change.
************************************************************************************

=== Elasticsearch Version Compatibility

The client major versions correspond to the Elasticsearch major versions:
to connect to Elasticsearch `6.x`, use a `6.x` version of the client,
to connect to Elasticsearch `7.x`, use a `7.x` version of the client, and so on.

The `master` branch of the client is compatible with the `master` branch of Elasticsearch.
