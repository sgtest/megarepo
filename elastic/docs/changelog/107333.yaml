  title: Limit how much space some string functions can use
  area: REST API
  details: "Before this change, some of the string functions could return a result\
    \ of any arbitrary length, which could force the VM to allocate large chunks of\
    \ memory or even make it exit. Any user with access to the SQL API can invoke\
    \ these functions. This change introduces a limitation  of how much memory the\
    \ result returned by a function call can consume. The functions affected by this\
    \ change are: CONCAT, INSERT, REPEAT,  REPLACE and SPACE."
  impact: "The affected functions used to return a result of any length. After this\
    \ change, a result can no longer exceed 1MB in length. Note that this is a bytes\
    \ length, the character count may be lower."
