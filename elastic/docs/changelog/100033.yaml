summary: "[Behavioral Analytics] Analytics collections use Data Stream Lifecycle (DSL)\
  \ instead of Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) for data retention management. Behavioral\
  \ analytics has traditionally used ILM to manage data retention. Starting with 8.12.0,\
  \ this will change. Analytics collections created prior to 8.12.0 will continue to use\
  \ their existing ILM policies, but new analytics collections will be managed using DSL."
