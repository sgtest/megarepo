  title: -|
    Configuring a bind DN in an LDAP or Active Directory (AD) realm without
    a corresponding bind password is deprecated
  area: Cluster and node setting
  details: -|
    For LDAP or AD authentication realms, setting a bind DN (via the
    `xpack.security.authc.realms.ldap.*.bind_dn` realm setting) without a
    bind password is a misconfiguration that may prevent successful
    authentication to the node. In the next major release, nodes will fail
    to start if a bind DN is specified without a password.
  impact: -|
    If you have a bind DN configured for an LDAP or AD authentication
    realm, set a bind password for
    [LDAP](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/ldap-realm.html#ldap-realm-configuration)
    or [Active
    Directory](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/active-directory-realm.html#ad-realm-configuration).
    Configuring a bind DN without a password generates a warning in the
    deprecation logs.

    *Note:* This deprecation only applies if your current LDAP or AD
    configuration specifies a bind DN without a password. This scenario is
    unlikely, but might impact a small subset of users.
