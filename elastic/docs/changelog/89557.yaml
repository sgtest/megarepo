  title: ILM no longer rolls over empty indices
  body: |-
    For both new and existing Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) policies,
    the rollover action will only execute if an index has at least one document.

    For indices with a `max_age` condition that are no longer being written
    to, this will mean that they will no longer roll over every time their
    `max_age` is reached.

    A policy can override this behavior, and explicitly opt in to rolling over
    empty indices, by adding a `"min_docs": 0` condition:

    [source,console]
    ----
    PUT _ilm/policy/allow_empty_rollover_policy
    {
      "policy": {
        "phases": {
          "hot": {
            "actions": {
              "rollover" : {
                "max_age": "7d",
                "max_size": "100gb",
                "min_docs": 0
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ----

    This can also be disabled on a cluster-wide basis by setting
    `indices.lifecycle.rollover.only_if_has_documents` to `false`.
