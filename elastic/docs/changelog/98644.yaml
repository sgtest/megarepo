  title: The data stream lifecycle is now generally available
  body: |-
    This makes the data stream lifecycle generaly available. Data streams will 
    be able to take advantage of a built-in simplified and resilient
    lifecycle implementation. Data streams with a configured lifecycle will
    be automatically rolled over and tail merged (a forcemerge implementation 
    that's lightweight and only merges the long tail of small segments instead 
    of the whole shard). With the shard and index maintenance tasks being 
    handled automatically to ensure optimum performance, and trade-off between
    indexing and searching, you'll be able to focus on the business related 
    lifecycle aspects like data retention. The automatic maintenance tasks will
    automatically be available for any new data stream that's not managed by 
    ILM.
