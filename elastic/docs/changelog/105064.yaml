  title: "ES|QL: remove PROJECT keyword from the grammar"
  area: REST API
  details: "Removes the PROJECT keyword (an alias for KEEP) from ES|QL grammar"
  impact: "Before this change, users could use PROJECT as an alias for KEEP in ESQL queries,\
    \ (eg. 'FROM idx | PROJECT name, surname')\
    \ the parser replaced PROJECT with KEEP, emitted a warning:\
    \ 'PROJECT command is no longer supported, please use KEEP instead'\
    \ and the query was executed normally.\
    \ With this change, PROJECT command is no longer recognized by the query parser;\
    \ queries using PROJECT command now return a parsing exception."
