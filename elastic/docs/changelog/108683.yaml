    Adds support for the ['GeoIP2 Connection
    Type'](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/docs/databases/connection-type)
    database from MaxMind to the `geoip` processor.

    The `geoip` processor will automatically download the [various
    'GeoLite2'
    databases](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data),
    but the 'GeoIP2 Connection Type' database is not a 'GeoLite2' database
    -- it's a commercial database available to those with a suitable license
    from MaxMind.

    The support that is being added for it in this PR is in line with the
    support that we already have for MaxMind's 'GeoIP2 City' and 'GeoIP2
    Country' databases -- that is, one would need to arrange their own
    download management via some custom endpoint or otherwise arrange for
    the relevant file(s) to be in the `$ES_CONFIG/ingest-geoip` directory on
    the nodes of the cluster.
