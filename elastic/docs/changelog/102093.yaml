  title: Add new `int8_hsnw` index type for int8 quantization for HNSW
  body: |-
    This commit adds a new index type called `int8_hnsw`. This index will
    automatically quantized float32 values into int8 byte values. While
    this increases disk usage by 25%, it reduces memory required for 
    fast HNSW search by 75%. Dramatically reducing the resource overhead
    required for dense vector search.
