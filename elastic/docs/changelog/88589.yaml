    === Optimizing speed of {dfanalytics}
    {dfanalytics-cap} is even faster in 8.4. The new function automatically 
    stops the process of hyperparameter optimization early in case of the 
    accuracy gain for a different set of hyperparameter values would be 
    insignificant. The early stopping of the optimization process results in a 
    shorter runtime for the {dfanalytics-job}.
