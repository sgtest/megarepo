  title: Change pre-configured and cached analyzer components to use IndexVersion instead of Version
  area: Java API
  details: |-
    This PR changes the types used to obtain pre-configured components from Version to IndexVersion,
    with corresponding changes to method names.

    Prior to 8.10, there is a one-to-one mapping between node version and index version, with corresponding constants
    in the IndexVersion class.
    Starting in 8.10, IndexVersion is versioned independently of node version, and will be a simple incrementing number.
    For more information on how to use IndexVersion and other version types, please see the contributing guide.

  body: |-
    As part of ongoing refactoring work, we are separating out various component versions into their own types.
    For this, we have introduced a new `IndexVersion` type to represent the version of index data and metadata.

    This PR changes the types used to obtain pre-configured components from Version to IndexVersion,
    with corresponding changes to method names.
