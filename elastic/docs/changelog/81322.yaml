    This speeds up a few aggregations when they don't have child aggregations.
    That's super common, for example, the histogram at the top of Kibana's
    discover tab is a `date_histogram` without any child aggregations. That
    particular aggregation is sped up by about 85% in our rally tests, dropping
    from 250ms to 30ms.
