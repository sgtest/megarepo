  title: Query phase KNN now supports query_vector_builder
  body: |-
    It is now possible to pass `model_text` and `model_id` within a `knn` query
    in the [query DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-knn-query.html) to convert a text query into a dense vector and run the
    nearest neighbor query on it, instead of requiring the dense vector to be
    directly passed (within the `query_vector` parameter). Similar to the
    [top-level knn query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/knn-search.html) (executed in the DFS phase), it is possible to supply
    a `query_vector_builder` object containing a `text_embedding` object with
    `model_text` (the text query to be converted into a dense vector) and
    `model_id` (the identifier of a deployed model responsible for transforming
    the text query into a dense vector). Note that an embedding model with the
    referenced `model_id` needs to be [deployed on a ML node](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/machine-learning/current/ml-nlp-deploy-models.html).
