  title: Interpret `?timeout=-1` as infinite ack timeout
  area: REST API
  details: |
    Today {es} accepts the parameter `?timeout=-1` in many APIs, but interprets
    this to mean the same as `?timeout=0`. From 8.15 onwards `?timeout=-1` will
    mean to wait indefinitely, aligning the behaviour of this parameter with
    other similar parameters such as `?master_timeout`.
  impact: |
    Use `?timeout=0` to force relevant operations to time out immediately
    instead of `?timeout=-1`
  notable: false
