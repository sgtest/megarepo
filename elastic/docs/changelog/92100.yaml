  title: Ensure balance threshold is at least 1
  area: Cluster and node setting
  details: Values for `cluster.routing.allocation.balance.threshold` smaller than
    `1` are now ignored. Support for values less than `1` for this setting is deprecated
    and will be forbidden in a future version.
  impact: Set `cluster.routing.allocation.balance.threshold` to be at least `1`.
