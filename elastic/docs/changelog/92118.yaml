  title: Allow more than one KNN search clause
  body: "Some vector search scenarios require relevance ranking using a few kNN clauses,\n\
  e.g. when ranking based on several fields, each with its own vector, or when a document \n\
  includes a vector for the image and another vector for the text. The user may want to obtain\n\
   relevance ranking based on a combination of all of these kNN clauses.\n\ncloses\
