  title: state field is deprecated in /_cluster/reroute response
  area: REST API
  details: |-
    `state` field is deprecated in `/_cluster/reroute` response. Cluster state does not provide meaningful information
    about the result of reroute/commands execution. There are no guarantees that this exact state would be applied.
  impact: |-
    Reroute API users should not rely on `state` field and instead use `explain` to request result of commands execution.
