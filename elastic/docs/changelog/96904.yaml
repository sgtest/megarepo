  title: Switch TDigestState to use `HybridDigest` by default
  area: REST API
  details: "The default implementation for TDigest in percentile calculations switches\
    \ to a new internal implementation offering superior performance (2x-10x speedup),\
    \ at a very small accuracy penalty for very large sample populations."
  impact: "This change leads to generating slightly different results in percentile\
    \ calculations. If the highest possible accuracy is desired, or it's crucial to\
    \ produce exactly the same results as in previous versions, one can either set\
    \ `execution_hint` to `high_accuracy` in the `tdigest` spec of a given percentile\
    \ calculation, or set `search.aggs.tdigest_execution_hint` to `high_accuracy`\
    \ in cluster settings to apply to all percentile queries."
