  title: Deprecate silently ignoring type, fields, copy_to and boost in metadata field definition
  area: Mapping
  details: Unsupported parameters like type, fields, copy_to and boost are silently ignored when
    provided as part of the configuration of a metadata field in the index mappings. They will
    cause a deprecation warning when used in the mappings for indices that are created from 8.6
    onwards.
  impact: To resolve the deprecation warning, remove the mention of type, fields, copy_to or boost
    from any metadata field definition as part of index mappings. They take no effect so removing
    them won't have any impact besides resolving the deprecation warning.
