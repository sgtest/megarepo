  title: Add new int4 quantization to dense_vector
  body: |-
    New int4 (half-byte) scalar quantization support via two knew index types: `int4_hnsw` and `int4_flat`.
    This gives an 8x reduction from `float32` with some accuracy loss. In addition to less memory required, this
    improves query and merge speed significantly when compared to raw vectors.
