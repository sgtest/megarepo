  title: Remove the unused executor builder for vector tile plugin
  area: Cluster and node setting
  details: "The threadpool called `vectortile` is a left over from the original development of the\
    \ vector tile search end point and it is used nowhere. It can still be a breaking change\
    \ if it is configured on the elasticsearch yml file, for example by changing the threadpool\
    \ size `thread_pool.vectortile.size=8`'"
  impact: "In the case the threadpool appears on the yaml file, Elasticsearch will not start until those\
    \ lines are removed."
  notable: false
