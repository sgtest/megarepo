  title: Deprecate 'remove_binary' default of false for ingest attachment processor
  area: CRUD
  details: The default "remove_binary" option for the attachment processor will be changed from false to true in a later Elasticsearch release. This means that the binary file sent to Elasticsearch will not be retained.
  impact: Users should update the "remove_binary" option to be explicitly true or false, instead of relying on the default value, so that no default value changes will affect Elasticsearch.
