  title: HTTP Status code has changed for the Cluster Health API in case of a server timeout
  area: REST API
  details: |-
    The cluster health API includes options for waiting
    for certain health conditions to be satisfied. If the requested conditions are
    not satisfied within a timeout then ES will send back a normal response
    including the field `"timed_out": true`. In earlier versions it would also use
    the HTTP response code `408 Request timeout` if the request timed out, and `200
    OK` otherwise. The `408 Request timeout` response code is not appropriate for
    this situation, so from version 8.0.0 ES will use the response code `200 OK`
    for both cases.
  impact: |-
    To detect a server timeout, check the `timed_out` field of the JSON response.
