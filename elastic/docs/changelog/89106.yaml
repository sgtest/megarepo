  title: Speed up SQL queries by not tracking total hits by default
  body: |-
    SQL query translator now explicitly sets track_total_hits to false when
    not needed.
    This has a significant impact on SQL query performance in cases where total hits
    are not needed to calculate the final result, in particular when the cost of evaluation
    of a single document is particularly high (eg. queries that involve script evaluation)
    and in queries with a small LIMIT value.
    In our tests, on some specific queries, we see a speed-up of more than 50%,
    with peaks of ~95% (from 600ms to 20ms).
  notable: true
