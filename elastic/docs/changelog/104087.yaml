  title: Deprecate machine learning on Intel macOS
  area: Packaging
  details: The machine learning plugin will be permanently disabled on macOS x86_64
    in new minor versions released from December 2024 onwards.
  impact: To continue to use machine learning functionality on macOS please switch to
    an arm64 machine (Apple silicon). Alternatively, it will still be possible to run
    Elasticsearch with machine learning enabled in a Docker container on macOS x86_64.
