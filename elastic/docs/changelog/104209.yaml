  title: '`DesiredNode:` deprecate `node_version` field and make it optional for the current version'
  area: REST API
  details: The desired_node API includes a `node_version` field to perform validation on the new node version required.
    This kind of check is too broad, and it's better done by external logic, so it has been removed, making the
    `node_version` field not necessary. The field will be removed in a later version.
  impact: Users should update their usages of `desired_node` to not include the `node_version` field anymore.
