  title: Add support for Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to the search API
  body: |-
    This change adds reciprocal rank fusion (RRF) which follows the basic formula
    for merging `1...n` sets of results sets together with `sum(1/(k+d))` where `k`
    is a ranking constant and `d` is a document's scored position within a result set
    from a query. The main advantage of ranking this way is the scores for the sets
    of results do not have to be normalized relative to each other because RRF only
    relies upon positions within each result set.

    The API for this change adds a `rank` top-level element to the search
    endpoint. An example:

    [source,Java]
    ----
    {
      "query": {
        "match": {
          "product": {
            "query": "brown shoes"
          }
        }
      },
      "knn": {
        "field": "product-vector",
        "query_vector": [54, 10, -2],
        "k": 20,
        "num_candidates": 75
      },
      "rank": {
         "rrf": {
            "window_size": 100,
            "rank_constant": 20
         }
      }
    }
    ----

    The above example will execute the search query and the knn search separately.
    It will preserve separate result sets up to the point where the queries are
    ranked on the coordinating node using RRF.
