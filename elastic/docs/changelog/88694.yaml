  title: Integrate ANN into `_search` endpoint
  body: |-
    This change adds a `knn` option to the `_search` API to support ANN
    search. It's powered by the same Lucene ANN capabilities as the old
    `_knn_search` endpoint. The `knn` option can be combined with other
    search features like queries and aggregations.
