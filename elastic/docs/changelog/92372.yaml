  title: Speed up ingest geoip processors
  body: |-
    The `geoip` ingest processor is significantly faster.

    Previous versions of the geoip library needed special permission to execute
    databinding code, requiring an expensive permissions check and
    `AccessController.doPrivileged` call. The current version of the geoip
    library no longer requires that, however, so the expensive code has been
    removed, resulting in better performance for the ingest geoip processor.
