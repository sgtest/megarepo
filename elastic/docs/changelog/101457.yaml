summary: "Remove Plugin.createComponents method in favour of overload with a PluginServices object"

  area: "Java API"
  title: "Plugin.createComponents method has been refactored to take a single PluginServices object"
  details: >
    Plugin.createComponents currently takes several different service arguments. The signature of this method changes
    every time a new service is added. The method has now been modified to take a single interface object
    that new services are added to. This will reduce API incompatibility issues when a new service
    is introduced in the future.
  impact: "Plugins that override createComponents will need to be refactored to override the new method on ES 8.12+"
