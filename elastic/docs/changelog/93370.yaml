  title: Support geo_grid ingest processor
  body: |-
    The `geo_grid` ingest processor supports creating indexable geometries from geohash, geotile and H3 cells.

    There already exists a `circle` ingest processor that creates a polygon from a point and radius definition.
    This concept is useful when there is need to use spatial operations that work with indexable geometries on
    geometric objects that are not defined spatially (or at least not indexable by lucene).
    In this case, the string `4/8/5` does not have spatial meaning, until we interpret it as the address
    of a rectangular `geotile`, and save the bounding box defining its border for further use.
    Likewise we can interpret `geohash` strings like `u0` as a tile, and H3 strings like `811fbffffffffff`
    as an hexagonal cell, saving the cell border as a polygon.
