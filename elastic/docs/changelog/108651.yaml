  title: Add support for the 'ISP' database to the geoip processor
  body: |-
    Follow on to https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/107287,
    https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/107377, and
    https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/108639

    Adds support for the ['GeoIP2
    ISP'](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/docs/databases/isp) database from
    MaxMind to the geoip processor.

    The geoip processor will automatically download the [various 'GeoLite2'
    databases](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data),
    but the 'GeoIP2 ISP' database is not a 'GeoLite2' database -- it's a
    commercial database available to those with a suitable license from
    MaxMind.

    The support that is being added for it in this PR is in line with the
    support that we already have for MaxMind's 'GeoIP2 City' and 'GeoIP2
    Country' databases -- that is, one would need to arrange their own
    download management via some custom endpoint or otherwise arrange for
    the relevant file(s) to be in the $ES_CONFIG/ingest-geoip directory on
    the nodes of the cluster.
