  title: Use `IndexWriter.flushNextBuffer()` to reclaim memory from indexing buffers
  body: |-
    Rather than forcing a refresh to reclaim memory from indexing buffers, which flushes all
    segments no matter how large, Elasticsearch now takes advantage of
    `IndexWriter#flushNextBuffer` which only flushes the largest pending segment. This should smooth
    out indexing allowing for larger segment sizes, fewer merges and higher throughput.

    Furthermore, the selection algorithm to pick which shard to reclaim memory from next was
    changed, from picking the shard that uses the most RAM to going over shards in a round-robin
    fashion. This approach has proved to work significantly better in practice.
