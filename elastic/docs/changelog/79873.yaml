  title: Require Java 17 for running Elasticsearch
  area: Packaging
  details: |-
    Java 17 or higher is now required to run Elasticsearch and any of its command
    line tools.
  impact: |-
    Use Java 17 or higher. Attempts to run Elasticsearch 8.0 using earlier Java versions will
    fail.

    There is not yet a FIPS-certified security module for Java 17
    that you can use when running Elasticsearch 8.0 in FIPS 140-2 mode.
    If you run in FIPS 140-2 mode, you will either need to request an exception
    from your security organization to upgrade to Elasticsearch 8.0,
    or remain on Elasticsearch 7.x until Java 17 is certified.
