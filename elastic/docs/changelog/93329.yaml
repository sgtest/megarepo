  title: Speed up ingest processing with multiple pipelines
  body: |-
    Processing documents with both a request/default and a final
    pipeline is significantly faster.

    Rather than marshalling a document from and to json once per
    pipeline, a document is now marshalled from json before any
    pipelines execute and then back to json after all pipelines have
    executed.
  notable: true
