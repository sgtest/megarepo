   title: Minimum conditions for the rollover API and ILM actions
   body: |-
     The rollover API and ILM actions now support minimum conditions for rollover.

     Minimum conditions prevent rollover from occuring until they are met. That is, an index
     will rollover once one or more max conditions are satisfied and all min conditions are satisfied.

     As an example, the following ILM policy would roll an index over if it is at least 7 days old or
     at least 100 gigabytes, but only as long as the index is not empty.

     ```
     PUT _ilm/policy/my_policy
     {
       "policy": {
         "phases": {
           "hot": {
             "actions": {
               "rollover" : {
                 "max_age": "7d",
                 "max_size": "100gb",
                 "min_docs": 1
               }
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
     ```
