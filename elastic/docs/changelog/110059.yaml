  title: Adds new `bit` `element_type` for `dense_vectors`
  body: |-
    This adds `bit` vector support by adding `element_type: bit` for
    vectors. This new element type works for indexed and non-indexed
    vectors. Additionally, it works with `hnsw` and `flat` index types. No
    quantization based codec works with this element type, this is
    consistent with `byte` vectors.

    `bit` vectors accept up to `32768` dimensions in size and expect vectors
    that are being indexed to be encoded either as a hexidecimal string or a
    `byte[]` array where each element of the `byte` array represents `8`
    bits of the vector.

    `bit` vectors support script usage and regular query usage. When
    indexed, all comparisons done are `xor` and `popcount` summations (aka,
    hamming distance), and the scores are transformed and normalized given
    the vector dimensions.

    For scripts, `l1norm` is the same as `hamming` distance and `l2norm` is
    `sqrt(l1norm)`. `dotProduct` and `cosineSimilarity` are not supported. 

    Note, the dimensions expected by this element_type are always to be
    divisible by `8`, and the `byte[]` vectors provided for index must be
    have size `dim/8` size, where each byte element represents `8` bits of
    the vectors.
