  title: Add multiple queries for ranking to the search endpoint
  body: "The search endpoint adds a new top-level element called `sub_searches`. \
  This top-level element is a list of searches used for ranking where each \
  \"sub search\" is executed independently. The `sub_searches` element is \
  used instead of `query` to allow a search using ranking to execute \
  multiple queries. The `sub_searches` and `query` elements cannot be used \
  together."
