  title: Release time series data stream (TSDS) functionality
  body: |-
    Elasticsearch offers support for time series data stream (TSDS) indices. A TSDS index is
     an index that contains time series metrics data as part of a data stream. Elasticsearch 
     routes the incoming documents into a TSDS index so
    that all the documents for a particular time series are on the same shard, and
    then sorts the shard by time series and timestamp. This structure
    has a few advantages:

    1. Documents from the same time series are next to each other on the shard, and
    hence stored next to each other on the disk, so the operating system
    pages are much more homogeneous and compress better, yielding massive reduction
    in TCO.

    2. The analysis of a time series typically involves comparing each two consecutive
    docs (samples), examining the last doc in a given time window, etc., which is quite
    complex when the next doc could be on any shard, and in fact on any index. Sorting
    by time series and timestamp allows improved analysis, both in terms of performance
    and in terms of our ability to add new aggregations.

    Finally,  as part of the Index Lifecycle Management of metrics data time series,
    Elasticsearch enables a Downsampling action. When an index is downsampled,
    Elasticsearch keeps a single document with statistical summaries per each bucket
    of time in the time series. Supported aggregations can then be run on the data
    stream and include both downsampled indices and raw data indices, without the
    user needing to be aware of that. Downsampling of downsampled indices, to more
    coarse time resolution, is also supported.
