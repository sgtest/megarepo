  title: A SIMD (Neon) optimised vector distance function for merging int8 Scalar Quantized vectors has been added
  body: |-
    An optimised int8 vector distance implementation for aarch64 has been added.
    This implementation is currently only used during merging.
    The vector distance implementation outperforms Lucene's Pamana Vector
    implementation for binary comparisons by approx 5x (depending on the number
    of dimensions). It does so by means of SIMD (Neon) intrinsics compiled into a
    separate native library and link by Panama's FFI. Comparisons are performed on
    off-heap mmap'ed vector data.
    Macro benchmarks, SO_Dense_Vector with scalar quantization enabled, shows
    significant improvements in merge times, approximately 3 times faster.
