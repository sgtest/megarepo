  title: Infinite and adaptive retries for transforms
  body: |-
   Infinite and adaptive retries – available in 8.4 – makes it possible for 
   transforms to recover after a failure without any user intervention. Retries 
   can be configured per transform. The transform retries become less frequent 
   progressively. The interval between retries doubles after reaching a one-hour 
   threshold. This is because the possibility that retries solve the problem is 
   less likely after each failed retry.
   
   In the *Transforms* page in *{stack-manage-app}* in {kib}, the number of retries 
   can be configured when creating a new transform or editing an existing one.
