    This <<remote-clusters-api-key,new model>> uses a cross-cluster API key to authenticate
    and authorize cross-cluster operations to a remote cluster. It completely separates
    network security controls between the local and remote cluster as well as offers
    administrators of both the local and the remote cluster fine-grained access controls.
