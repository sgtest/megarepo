  title: Fixed JWT principal from claims
  area: Authorization
  details: "This changes the format of a JWT's principal before the JWT is actually\
    \ validated by any JWT realm. The JWT's principal is a convenient way to refer\
    \ to a JWT that has not yet been verified by a JWT realm. The JWT's principal\
    \ is printed in the audit and regular logs (notably for auditing authn failures)\
    \ as well as the smart realm chain reordering optimization. The JWT principal\
    \ is NOT required to be identical to the JWT-authenticated user's principal, but\
    \ in general, they should be similar. Previously, the JWT's principal was built\
    \ by individual realms in the same way the realms built the authenticated user's\
    \ principal. This had the advantage that, in simpler JWT realms configurations\
    \ (e.g. a single JWT realm in the chain), the JWT principal and the authenticated\
    \ user's principal are very similar. However the drawback is that, in general,\
    \ the JWT principal and the user principal can be very different (i.e. in the\
    \ case where one JWT realm builds the JWT principal and a different one builds\
    \ the user principal). Another downside is that the (unauthenticated) JWT principal\
    \ depended on realm ordering, which makes identifying the JWT from its principal\
    \ dependent on the ES authn realm configuration. This PR implements a consistent\
    \ fixed logic to build the JWT principal, which only depends on the JWT's claims\
    \ and no ES configuration."
  impact: "Users will observe changed format and values for the `user.name` attribute\
    \ of `authentication_failed` audit log events, in the JWT (failed) authn case."
