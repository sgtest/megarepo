  title: "ESQL: Grammar - FROM METADATA no longer requires []"
  area: REST API
  details: "Remove [ ] for METADATA option inside FROM command statements"
  impact: "Previously to return metadata fields, one had to use square brackets:\
    \ (eg. 'FROM index [METADATA _index]').\
    \ This is no longer needed: the [ ] are dropped and do not have to be specified,\
    \ thus simplifying the command above to:'FROM index METADATA _index'."
  notable: false
