  title: The data stream lifecycle is now in Technical Preview
  body: "This marks the data stream lifecycle as available in Technical Preview.
    Data streams will be able to take advantage of a built-in simplified and 
    resilient lifecycle implementation. Data streams with a configured lifecycle will 
    be automatically rolled over and tail merged (a forcemerge implementation that's
    lightweight and only merges the long tail of small segments instead of the
    whole shard). With the shard and index maintenance tasks being handled automatically
    to ensure optimum performance, and trade-off between indexing and searching,
    you'll be able to focus on the business related lifecycle aspects like data
    retention."
