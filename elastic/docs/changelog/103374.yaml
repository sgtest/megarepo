  title: Stored fields are now compressed with ZStandard instead of LZ4/DEFLATE
  body: |-
    Stored fields are now compressed by splitting documents into blocks, which
    are then compressed independently with ZStandard. `index.codec: default`
    (default) uses blocks of at most 14kB or 128 documents compressed with level
    0, while `index.codec: best_compression` uses blocks of at most 240kB or
    2048 documents compressed at level 3. On most datasets that we tested
    against, this yielded storage improvements in the order of 10%, slightly
    faster indexing and similar retrieval latencies.
