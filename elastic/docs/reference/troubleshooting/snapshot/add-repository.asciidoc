== Multiple deployments writing to the same snapshot repository

Multiple {es} deployments are writing to the same snapshot repository. {es} doesn't 
support this configuration and only one cluster is allowed to write to the same 
repository. See <<snapshot-repository-contents>> for potential side-effects of
corruption of the repository contents, which may not be resolved by the following
guide.
To remedy the situation mark the repository as read-only or remove it from all the
other deployments, and re-add (recreate) the repository in the current deployment:
