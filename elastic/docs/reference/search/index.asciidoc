[[search-query]]
A _search query_, or _query_, is a request for information about data in one or
more {es} indices.

You can think of a query as a question, written in a way {es} understands.
Depending on your data, you can use a query to get answers to questions like:

* What pages on my website contain a specific word or phrase?
* What processes on my server take longer than 500 milliseconds to respond?
* What users on my network ran `regsvr32.exe` within the last week?
* How many of my products have a price greater than $20? 

A _search_ consists of one or more queries that are combined and sent to {es}.
Documents that match a search's queries are returned in the _hits_, or
_search results_, of the response.

A search may also contain additional information used to better process its
queries. For example, a search may be limited to a specific index or only return
a specific number of results.
