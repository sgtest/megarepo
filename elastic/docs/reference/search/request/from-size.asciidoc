=== Paginate search results

By default, the search API returns the top 10 matching documents.

To paginate through a larger set of results, you can use the search API's `size`
and `from` parameters. The `size` parameter is the number of matching documents
to return. The `from` parameter is a zero-indexed offset from the beginning of
the complete result set that indicates the document you want to start with.

.*Example*
[%collapsible]
====
The following search API request sets the `from` offset to `5`, meaning the
request offsets, or skips, the first five matching documents.

The `size` parameter is `20`, meaning the request can return up to 20 documents,
starting at the offset.

GET /_search
{
  "from": 5,
  "size": 20,
  "query": {
    "term": { "user": "kimchy" }
  }
}
----
====

By default, you cannot page through more than 10,000 documents using the `from`
and `size` parameters. This limit is set using the
<<index-max-result-window,`index.max_result_window`>> index setting.

Deep paging or requesting many results at once can result in slow searches.
Results are sorted before being returned. Because search requests usually span
multiple shards, each shard must generate its own sorted results. These separate
results must then be combined and sorted to ensure that the overall sort order
is correct.

As an alternative to deep paging, we recommend using
<<request-body-search-scroll,scroll>> or the
<<request-body-search-search-after,`search_after`>> parameter.

WARNING: {es} uses Lucene's internal doc IDs as tie-breakers. These internal
doc IDs can be completely different across replicas of the same
data. When paginating, you might occasionally see that documents with the same
sort values are not ordered consistently.
