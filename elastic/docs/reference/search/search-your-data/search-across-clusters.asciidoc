[[modules-cross-cluster-search]]
== Search across clusters

*{ccs-cap}* lets you run a single search request against one or more
<<modules-remote-clusters,remote clusters>>. For example, you can use a {ccs} to
filter and analyze log data stored on clusters in different data centers.

IMPORTANT: {ccs-cap} requires <<modules-remote-clusters, remote clusters>>.

[[ccs-remote-cluster-setup]]
==== Remote cluster setup

To perform a {ccs}, you must have at least one remote cluster configured.

TIP: If you want to search across clusters in the cloud, you can
link:{cloud}/ec-enable-ccs.html[configure remote clusters on {ess}]. Then, you
can search across clusters and <<ccr-getting-started,set up {ccr}>>.

The following <<cluster-update-settings,cluster update settings>> API request
adds three remote clusters:`cluster_one`, `cluster_two`, and `cluster_three`.

[discrete]
[[skip-unavailable-clusters]]
=== Skip unavailable clusters

By default, a {ccs} returns an error if *any* cluster in the request is
unavailable.

To skip an unavailable cluster during a {ccs}, set the
<<skip-unavailable,`skip_unavailable`>> cluster setting to `true`.

The following <<cluster-update-settings,cluster update settings>> API request
changes `cluster_two`'s `skip_unavailable` setting to `true`.

[source,console]
--------------------------------
PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent": {
    "cluster.remote.cluster_two.skip_unavailable": true
  }
}
--------------------------------
// TEST[continued]

If `cluster_two` is disconnected or unavailable during a {ccs}, {es} won't
include matching documents from that cluster in the final results.

[discrete]
[[ccs-gateway-seed-nodes]]
=== Selecting gateway and seed nodes in sniff mode

For remote clusters using the <<sniff-mode,sniff connection>> mode, gateway and
seed nodes need to be accessible from the local cluster via your network.

By default, any non-<<master-node,master-eligible>> node can act as a
gateway node. If wanted, you can define the gateway nodes for a cluster by
setting `cluster.remote.node.attr.gateway` to `true`.

For {ccs}, we recommend you use gateway nodes that are capable of serving as
<<coordinating-node,coordinating nodes>> for search requests. If
wanted, the seed nodes for a cluster can be a subset of these gateway nodes.

[discrete]
[[ccs-proxy-mode]]
=== {ccs-cap} in proxy mode

<<proxy-mode,Proxy mode>> remote cluster connections support {ccs}. All remote
connections connect to the configured `proxy_address`. Any desired connection
routing to gateway or <<coordinating-node,coordinating nodes>> must
be implemented by the intermediate proxy at this configured address.

[discrete]
[[ccs-network-delays]]
=== How {ccs} handles network delays

Because {ccs} involves sending requests to remote clusters, any network delays
can impact search speed. To avoid slow searches, {ccs} offers two options for
handling network delays:

<<ccs-min-roundtrips,Minimize network roundtrips>>::
By default, {es} reduces the number of network roundtrips between remote
clusters. This reduces the impact of network delays on search speed. However,
{es} can't reduce network roundtrips for large search requests, such as those
including a <<scroll-search-results, scroll>> or
<<inner-hits,inner hits>>.
+
See <<ccs-min-roundtrips>> to learn how this option works.

<<ccs-unmin-roundtrips, Don't minimize network roundtrips>>:: For search
requests that include a scroll or inner hits, {es} sends multiple outgoing and
ingoing requests to each remote cluster. You can also choose this option by
setting the <<ccs-minimize-roundtrips,`ccs_minimize_roundtrips`>> parameter to
`false`. While typically slower, this approach may work well for networks with
low latency.
+
See <<ccs-unmin-roundtrips>> to learn how this option works.

[discrete]
[[ccs-min-roundtrips]]
==== Minimize network roundtrips

Here's how {ccs} works when you minimize network roundtrips.

. You send a {ccs} request to your local cluster. A coordinating node in that
cluster receives and parses the request.
+
image:images/ccs/ccs-min-roundtrip-client-request.svg[]

. The coordinating node sends a single search request to each cluster, including
the local cluster. Each cluster performs the search request independently,
applying its own cluster-level settings to the request.
+
image:images/ccs/ccs-min-roundtrip-cluster-search.svg[]

. Each remote cluster sends its search results back to the coordinating node.
+
image:images/ccs/ccs-min-roundtrip-cluster-results.svg[]

. After collecting results from each cluster, the coordinating node returns the
final results in the {ccs} response.
+
image:images/ccs/ccs-min-roundtrip-client-response.svg[]

[discrete]
[[ccs-unmin-roundtrips]]
==== Don't minimize network roundtrips

Here's how {ccs} works when you don't minimize network roundtrips.

. You send a {ccs} request to your local cluster. A coordinating node in that
cluster receives and parses the request.
+
image:images/ccs/ccs-min-roundtrip-client-request.svg[]

. The coordinating node sends a <<search-shards,search shards>> API request to
each remote cluster.
+
image:images/ccs/ccs-min-roundtrip-cluster-search.svg[]

. Each remote cluster sends its response back to the coordinating node.
This response contains information about the indices and shards the {ccs}
request will be executed on.
+
image:images/ccs/ccs-min-roundtrip-cluster-results.svg[]

. The coordinating node sends a search request to each shard, including those in
its own cluster. Each shard performs the search request independently.
+
[WARNING]
====
When network roundtrips aren't minimized, the search is executed as if all data
were in the coordinating node's cluster. We recommend updating cluster-level
settings that limit searches, such as `action.search.shard_count.limit`,
`pre_filter_shard_size`, and `max_concurrent_shard_requests`, to account for
this. If these limits are too low, the search may be rejected.
====

final results in the {ccs} response.

[[ccs-supported-configurations]]
=== Supported configurations

Generally, <<gateway-nodes-selection, cross cluster search>> can search remote
clusters that are one major version ahead or behind the coordinating node's
version. Cross cluster search can also search remote clusters that are being
<<rolling-upgrades, upgraded>> so long as both the "upgrade from" and
"upgrade to" version are compatible with the gateway node.

For example, a coordinating node running {es} 5.6 can search a remote cluster
running {es} 6.8, but that cluster can not be upgraded to 7.1. In this case
you should first upgrade the coordinating node to 7.1 and then upgrade remote
cluster.

WARNING: Running multiple versions of {es} in the same cluster beyond the
duration of an upgrade is not supported.

Only features that exist across all searched clusters are supported. Using
a recent feature with a remote cluster where the feature is not supported
will result in undefined behavior.
