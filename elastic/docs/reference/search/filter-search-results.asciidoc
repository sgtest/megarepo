== Filter search results

You can use two methods to filter search results:

* Use a boolean query with a `filter` clause. Search requests apply
<<query-dsl-bool-query,boolean filters>> to both search hits and
<<search-aggregations,aggregations>>.

* Use the search API's `post_filter` parameter. Search requests apply
<<post-filter,post filters>> only to search hits, not aggregations. You can use
a post filter to calculate aggregations based on a broader result set, and then
further narrow the results.
+
You can also <<rescore,rescore>> hits after the post filter to
improve relevance and reorder results.
