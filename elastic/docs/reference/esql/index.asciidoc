The {es} Query Language ({esql}) provides a powerful way to filter, transform, and analyze data stored in {es}, and in the future in other runtimes.
It is designed to be easy to learn and use, by end users, SRE teams, application developers, and administrators.

Users can author {esql} queries to find specific events, perform statistical analysis, and generate visualizations.
It supports a wide range of commands and functions that enable users to perform various data operations,
such as filtering, aggregation, time-series analysis, and more.

The {es} Query Language ({esql}) makes use of "pipes" (|) to manipulate and transform data in a step-by-step fashion.
This approach allows users to compose a series of operations, where the output of one operation becomes the input for the next,
enabling complex data transformations and analysis.

=== The {esql} Compute Engine

{esql} is more than a language: it represents a significant investment in new compute capabilities within {es}.
To achieve both the functional and performance requirements for {esql}, it was necessary to build an entirely new
compute architecture. {esql} search, aggregation, and transformation functions are directly executed within Elasticsearch
itself. Query expressions are not transpiled to Query DSL for execution. This approach allows {esql} to be extremely performant and versatile.

The new {esql} execution engine was designed with performance in mind â€” it operates on blocks at a time instead of per row, targets vectorization and cache locality, and embraces specialization and multi-threading. It is a separate component from the existing Elasticsearch aggregation framework with different performance characteristics.
