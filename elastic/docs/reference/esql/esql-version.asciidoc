=== How versions work

{esql} language versions are independent of {es} versions.
Versioning the language ensures that your queries will always
remain valid, independent of new {es} and {esql} releases. And it lets us
evolve ESQL as we learn more from people using it. We don't plan to make
huge changes to it, but we know we've made mistakes and we don't want those
to live forever.

For instance, the following query will remain valid, even if a future
version of {esql} introduces syntax changes or changes how the used
commands or functions work.

[source,console]
----
POST /_query?format=txt
{
  "version": "2024.04.01",
  "query": """
    FROM library
    | EVAL release_month = DATE_TRUNC(1 month, release_date)
    | KEEP release_month
    | SORT release_month ASC
    | LIMIT 3
  """
}

// TEST[setup:library]

We won't make breaking changes to released {esql} versions and
versions will remain supported until they are deprecated.
New features, bug fixes, and performance improvements
will be continue to be added to released {esql} versions,
provided they do not involve breaking changes.
