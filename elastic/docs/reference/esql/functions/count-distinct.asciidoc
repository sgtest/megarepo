=== `COUNT_DISTINCT`

*Syntax*

[source,esql]
----
COUNT_DISTINCT(column[, precision])
----

*Parameters*

`column`::
Column for which to count the number of distinct values.

`precision`::
Precision. Refer to <<esql-agg-count-distinct-approximate>>.

*Description*

Returns the approximate number of distinct values.

==== Counts are approximate

Computing exact counts requires loading values into a set and returning its
size. This doesn't scale when working on high-cardinality sets and/or large
values as the required memory usage and the need to communicate those
per-shard sets between nodes would utilize too many resources of the cluster.

This `COUNT_DISTINCT` function is based on the

algorithm, which counts based on the hashes of the values with some interesting
properties:

The `COUNT_DISTINCT` function takes an optional second parameter to configure the
precision.

*Supported types*

Can take any field type as input.

*Examples*
