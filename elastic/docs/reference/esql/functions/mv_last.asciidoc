Converts a multivalued field into a single valued field containing the last value. This is most
useful when reading from a function that emits multivalued fields in a known order like <<esql-split>>:

[source.merge.styled,esql]
----
include::{esql-specs}/string.csv-spec[tag=mv_last]
----
[%header.monospaced.styled,format=dsv,separator=|]
|===
include::{esql-specs}/string.csv-spec[tag=mv_last-result]
|===

The order that <<esql-multivalued-fields, multivalued fields>> are read from underlying storage is not
guaranteed. It is *frequently* ascending, but don't rely on that. If you need the maximum field value
use <<esql-mv_max>> instead of `MV_LAST`. `MV_MAX` has optimizations for sorted values so there isn't
a performance benefit to `MV_LAST`. `MV_LAST` is mostly useful with functions that create multivalued
fields like `SPLIT`.
