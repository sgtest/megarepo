experimental::[]

{eql-ref}/index.html[Event Query Language (EQL)] is a query language for
event-based, time series data, such as logs.

[discrete]
[[eql-advantages]]
== Advantages of EQL

* *EQL lets you express relationships between events.* +
Many query languages allow you to match only single events. EQL lets you match a
sequence of events across different event categories and time spans.

* *EQL has a low learning curve.* +
<<eql-syntax,EQL syntax>> looks like other query languages. It lets you write
and read queries intuitively, which makes for quick, iterative searching.

* *We designed EQL for security use cases.* +
While you can use EQL for any event-based data, we created EQL for threat
hunting. EQL not only supports indicator of compromise (IOC) searching but
makes it easy to describe activity that goes beyond IOCs.

[discrete]
[[eql-required-fields]]
== Required fields

TIP: While no schema is required to use EQL in {es}, we recommend using the
{ecs-ref}[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)]. EQL search is designed to work
with core ECS fields by default.

EQL assumes each document in a data stream or index corresponds to an event. To
run an EQL search, each document must contain a _timestamp_ and _event category_
field.

EQL uses the `@timestamp` and `event.category` fields from the {ecs-ref}[ECS] as
the default timestamp and event category fields. If your documents use a
different timestamp or event category field, you must specify it in the search
request. See <<specify-a-timestamp-or-event-category-field>>.

[discrete]
[[run-an-eql-search]]
== Run an EQL search

You can use the <<eql-search-api,EQL search API>> to run an EQL search. For
supported query syntax, see <<eql-syntax>>.

The following request searches `my-index-000001` for events with an
`event.category` of `process` and a `process.name` of `regsvr32.exe`. Each
document in `my-index-000001` includes a `@timestamp` and `event.category`
field.

[source,console]

{
  "query": """
    process where process.name == "regsvr32.exe"
  """
}
----
// TEST[setup:sec_logs]

The API returns the following response. Matching events are included in the
`hits.events` property. These events are sorted by timestamp, converted to
milliseconds since the {wikipedia}/Unix_time[Unix epoch], in
ascending order.

[[eql-search-sequence]]
=== Search for a sequence of events

You can use EQL's <<eql-sequences,sequence syntax>> to search for an ordered
series of events.

The following EQL search request matches a sequence that:

. Starts with an event with:
+
--
* An `event.category` of `process`
* A `process.name` of `regsvr32.exe`
--
. Followed by an event with:
+
--
* An `event.category` of `file`
* A `file.name` that contains the substring `scrobj.dll`

You can use the <<eql-with-maxspan-keywords,`with maxspan` keywords>> to
constrain a sequence to a specified timespan.

The following EQL search request adds `with maxspan=1h` to the previous query.
This ensures all events in a matching sequence occur within `1h` (one hour) of
the first event's timestamp.

[source,console]

}
----
// TEST[setup:sec_logs]

You can further constrain matching event sequences using the
<<eql-by-keyword,`by` keyword>>.

The following EQL search request adds `by process.pid` to each event item. This
ensures events matching the sequence share the same `process.pid` field value.

[source,console]
----

  """
}
----
// TEST[setup:sec_logs]

Because the `process.pid` field is shared across all events in the sequence, it
can be included using `sequence by`. The following query is equivalent to the
previous one.

[source,console]

You can use the <<eql-until-keyword,`until` keyword>> to specify an expiration
event for sequences. Matching sequences must end before this event.

The following request adds `until [ process where event.type == "termination" ]`

[[specify-a-timestamp-or-event-category-field]]
=== Specify a timestamp or event category field

To run an EQL search, each searched document must contain a timestamp and event
category field. The EQL search API uses the `@timestamp` and `event.category`
fields from the {ecs-ref}[Elastic Common Schema (ECS)] by default. If your
documents use a different timestamp or event category field, you must specify it
in the search request using the `timestamp_field` or `event_category_field`
parameters.

The event category field is typically mapped as a field type in the
<<keyword,`keyword`>> family. The timestamp field is typically mapped as a
<<date,`date`>> or <<date_nanos,`date_nanos`>> field.

NOTE: You cannot use a <<nested,`nested`>> field or the sub-fields of a `nested`
field as the timestamp or event category field. See <<eql-nested-fields>>.

The following request uses the `timestamp_field` parameter to specify
`file.accessed` as the timestamp field. The request also uses the
`event_category_field` parameter to specify `file.type` as the event category
field.

[source,console]
----

[discrete]
[[eql-search-filter-query-dsl]]
=== Filter using query DSL

You can use the `filter` parameter to specify an additional query using
<<query-dsl,query DSL>>. This query filters the documents on which the EQL query
runs.

The following request uses a `range` query to filter `my-index-000001` to only
documents with a `file.size` value greater than `1` but less than `1000000`
bytes. The EQL query in `query` parameter then runs on these filtered documents.

[[eql-search-case-sensitive]]
=== Run a case-sensitive EQL search

By default, matching for EQL queries is case-insensitive. You can use the
`case_sensitive` parameter to toggle case sensitivity on or off.

The following search request contains a query that matches `process` events
with a `process.executable` containing `System32`.

Because `case_sensitive` is `true`, this query only matches `process.executable`
values containing `System32` with the exact same capitalization. A
`process.executable` value containing `system32` or `SYSTEM32` would not match
this query.

[source,console]
----
GET /my-index-000001/_eql/search

[discrete]
[[eql-search-async]]
=== Run an async EQL search

EQL searches are designed to run on large volumes of data quickly, often
returning results in milliseconds. For this reason, EQL searches are
_synchronous_ by default. The search request waits for complete results before
returning a response. 

However, complete results can take longer for searches across:

* <<frozen-indices,Frozen indices>>
* <<modules-cross-cluster-search,Multiple clusters>>
* Many shards

To avoid long waits, you can use the `wait_for_completion_timeout` parameter to
run an _asynchronous_, or _async_, EQL search.

Set `wait_for_completion_timeout` to a duration you'd like to wait
for complete search results. If the search request does not finish within this
period, the search becomes async and returns a response that includes:

* A search ID, which can be used to monitor the progress of the async search.
* An `is_partial` value of `true`, meaning the response does not contain
  complete search results.
* An `is_running` value of `true`, meaning the search is async and ongoing.

The async search continues to run in the background without blocking
other requests.

The following request searches the `frozen-my-index-000001` index, which has been
<<frozen-indices,frozen>> for storage and is rarely searched.

Because searches on frozen indices are expected to take longer to complete, the
request contains a `wait_for_completion_timeout` parameter value of `2s` (two
seconds). If the request does not return complete results in two seconds, the
search becomes async and returns a search ID.

[source,console]
----
GET /frozen-my-index-000001/_eql/search

and `is_running` properties are `true`, indicating an async search.

[source,console-result]

You can use the the search ID and the <<get-async-eql-search-api,get async EQL
search API>> to check the progress of an async search.

The get async EQL search API also accepts a `wait_for_completion_timeout`
parameter. If ongoing search does not complete during this period, the response
returns an `is_partial` value of `true` and no search results.

The following get async EQL search API request checks the progress of the
previous async EQL search. The request specifies a `wait_for_completion_timeout`
query parameter value of `2s` (two seconds).

[[eql-search-store-async-eql-search]]
=== Change the search retention period

By default, the EQL search API stores async searches for five days. After this
period, any searches and their results are deleted. You can use the `keep_alive`
parameter to change this retention period.

In the following EQL search request, the `keep_alive` parameter is `2d` (two
days). If the search becomes async, its results
are stored on the cluster for two days. After two days, the async
search and its results are deleted, even if it's still ongoing.

[source,console]

// TEST[setup:sec_logs]

You can use the <<get-async-eql-search-api,get async EQL search API>>'s
`keep_alive`parameter to later change the retention period. The new

=== Store synchronous EQL searches

By default, the EQL search API only stores async searches that cannot be
completed within the period set by `wait_for_completion_timeout`.

To save the results of searches that complete during this period, set the
`keep_on_completion` parameter to `true`.

In the following search request, `keep_on_completion` is `true`. This means the
search results are stored on the cluster, even if the search completes within
the `2s` (two-second) period set by the `wait_for_completion_timeout` parameter.

[source,console]
----
GET /my-index-000001/_eql/search
{
  "keep_on_completion": true,
  "wait_for_completion_timeout": "2s",
  "query": """
    process where process.name == "cmd.exe"
  """
}

// TEST[setup:sec_logs]

The API returns the following response. A search ID is provided in the `id`
property. `is_partial` and `is_running` are `false`, indicating the EQL search
was synchronous and returned complete results in `hits`.

{
  "id": "FjlmbndxNmJjU0RPdExBTGg0elNOOEEaQk9xSjJBQzBRMldZa1VVQ2pPa01YUToxMDY=",
  "is_partial": false,
  "is_running": false,
  "took": 52,
  "timed_out": false,
  "hits": ...
}

// TESTRESPONSE[s/FjlmbndxNmJjU0RPdExBTGg0elNOOEEaQk9xSjJBQzBRMldZa1VVQ2pPa01YUToxMDY=/$body.id/]
// TESTRESPONSE[s/"took": 52/"took": $body.took/]
// TESTRESPONSE[s/"hits": \.\.\./"hits": $body.hits/]

You can use the search ID and the <<get-async-eql-search-api,get async EQL
search API>> to retrieve the same results later.

Saved synchronous searches are still subject to the retention period set by the
`keep_alive` parameter. After this period, the search and its results are
deleted.

You can also manually delete saved synchronous searches using the
<<delete-async-eql-search-api,delete async EQL search API>>.
