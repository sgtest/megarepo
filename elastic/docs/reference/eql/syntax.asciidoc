[IMPORTANT]
====
{es} supports a subset of EQL syntax. See <<eql-limitations>>.
====

[discrete]
[[eql-basic-syntax]]
=== Basic syntax

EQL queries require an event category and a matching condition. The `where`
keyword connects them.

[source,eql]
----
event_category where condition
----

For example, the following EQL query matches `process` events with a
`process.name` field value of `svchost.exe`:

[source,eql]
----
process where process.name == "svchost.exe"
----

[discrete]
[[eql-syntax-event-categories]]
==== Event categories

In {es}, an event category is a valid, indexed value of the
<<eql-required-fields,event category field>>. You can set the event category
field using the `event_category_field` parameter of the EQL search API.

[discrete]
[[eql-syntax-match-any-event-category]]
===== Match any event category

To match events of any category, use the `any` keyword. You can also use the
`any` keyword to search for documents without a event category field.

For example, the following EQL query matches any documents with a
`network.protocol` field value of `http`:

[source,eql]
----
any where network.protocol == "http"
----

[discrete]
[[eql-syntax-conditions]]
==== Conditions

A condition consists of one or more criteria an event must match.
You can specify and combine these criteria using the following operators:

[discrete]
[[eql-syntax-comparison-operators]]
===== Comparison operators

[source,eql]
----
<   <=   ==   !=   >=   >
----

You cannot use comparison operators to compare a variable, such as a field
value, to another variable, even if those variables are modified using a
<eql-functions,function>>.

.*Example*
[%collapsible]
====
The following EQL query compares the `process.parent_name` field
value to a static value, `foo`. This comparison is supported.

However, the query also compares the `process.parent.name` field value to the
`process.name` field. This comparison is not supported and will return an
error for the entire query.

[source,eql]
----
process where process.parent.name == "foo" and process.parent.name == process.name
----

Instead, you can rewrite the query to compare both the `process.parent.name`
and `process.name` fields to static values.

[source,eql]
----
process where process.parent.name == "foo" and process.name == "foo"
----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Avoid using the equal operator (`==`) to perform exact matching on `text` field
values.

By default, {es} changes the values of <<text,`text`>> fields as part of
<<analysis, analysis>>. This can make finding exact matches for `text` field
values difficult.

To search `text` fields, consider using a <<eql-search-filter-query-dsl,query
DSL filter>> that contains a <<query-dsl-match-query,`match`>> query.

.*Definitions*
[%collapsible]
====
`<` (less than)::
Returns `true` if the value to the left of the operator is less than the value
to the right. Otherwise returns `false`.

`<=` (less than or equal) ::
Returns `true` if the value to the left of the operator is less than or equal to
the value to the right. Otherwise returns `false`.

`==` (equal)::
Returns `true` if the values to the left and right of the operator are equal.
Otherwise returns `false`.

`!=` (not equal)::
Returns `true` if the values to the left and right of the operator are not
equal. Otherwise returns `false`.

`>=` (greater than or equal) ::
Returns `true` if the value to the left of the operator is greater than or equal
to the value to the right. Otherwise returns `false`.

`>` (greater than)::
Returns `true` if the value to the left of the operator is greater than the
value to the right. Otherwise returns `false`.

[[eql-syntax-logical-operators]]
===== Logical operators

[source,eql]
----
and  or  not
----

.*Definitions*
[%collapsible]
====
`and`::
Returns `true` only if the condition to the left and right _both_ return `true`.
Otherwise returns `false.

`or`::
Returns `true` if one of the conditions to the left or right `true`.
Otherwise returns `false.

`not`::
Returns `true` if the condition to the right is `false`.
====

[discrete]
[[eql-syntax-lookup-operators]]
===== Lookup operators

[source,eql]
----
user.name in ("Administrator", "SYSTEM", "NETWORK SERVICE")
user.name not in ("Administrator", "SYSTEM", "NETWORK SERVICE")
----

.*Definitions*
[%collapsible]
====
`in`::
Returns `true` if the value is contained in the provided list.

`not in`::
Returns `true` if the value is not contained in the provided list.
====

[discrete]
[[eql-syntax-math-operators]]
===== Math operators

[source,eql]
----
+  -  *  /  %
----

.*Definitions*
[%collapsible]
====
`+` (add)::
Adds the values to the left and right of the operator.

`-` (Subtract)::
Subtracts the value to the right of the operator from the value to the left.

`*` (Subtract)::
Multiplies the values to the left and right of the operator.

`/` (Divide)::
Divides the value to the left of the operator by the value to the right.

`%` (modulo)::
Divides the value to the left of the operator by the value to the right. Returns only the remainder.
====

[[eql-divide-operator-float-rounding]]
[WARNING]
====
If both the dividend and divisor are integers, the divide (`\`) operation
_rounds down_ any returned floating point numbers to the nearest integer.

EQL queries in {es} should account for this rounding. To avoid rounding, convert
either the dividend or divisor to a float.

[%collapsible]
.**Example**
=====
The `process.args_count` field is a <<number,`long`>> integer field containing a
count of process arguments.

A user might expect the following EQL query to only match events with a
`process.args_count` value of `4`.

[source,eql]
----
process where ( 4 / process.args_count ) == 1
----

However, the EQL query matches events with a `process.args_count` value of `3`
or `4`.

For events with a `process.args_count` value of `3`, the divide operation
returns a float of `1.333...`, which is rounded down to `1`.

To match only events with a `process.args_count` value of `4`, convert
either the dividend or divisor to a float.

The following EQL query changes the integer `4` to the equivalent float `4.0`.

[source,eql]
----
process where ( 4.0 / process.args_count ) == 1
----
=====
====

[discrete]
[[eql-syntax-strings]]
==== Strings

Strings are enclosed with double quotes (`"`) or single quotes (`'`).

[source,eql]
----
"hello world"
"hello world with 'substring'"
----

[discrete]
[[eql-syntax-wildcards]]
===== Wildcards

You can use the wildcard operator (`*`) within a string to match specific
patterns. You can use wildcards with the `==` (equal) or `!=` (not equal)
operators:

[source,eql]
----
field == "example*wildcard"
field != "example*wildcard"
----

[discrete]
[[eql-syntax-match-any-condition]]
===== Match any condition

To match events solely on event category, use the `where true` condition.

For example, the following EQL query matches any `file` events:

[source,eql]
----
file where true
----

To match any event, you can combine the `any` keyword with the `where true`
condition:

[source,eql]
----
any where true
----

[discrete]
[[eql-syntax-escaped-characters]]
===== Escaped characters

When used within a string, special characters, such as a carriage return or
double quote (`"`), must be escaped with a preceding backslash (`\`).

[source,eql]
----
"example \t of \n escaped \r characters"
----

.*Escape sequences*
[%collapsible]
====
[options="header"]
|====
| Escape sequence | Literal character
|`\n`             | A newline (linefeed) character
|`\r`             | A carriage return character
|`\t`             | A tab character
|`\\`             | A backslash (`\`) character
|`\"`             | A double quote (`"`) character
|`\'`             | A single quote (`'`) character
|====
====

[discrete]
[[eql-syntax-raw-strings]]
===== Raw strings

Raw strings are preceded by a question mark (`?`) and treat backslashes (`\`) as
literal characters.

[source,eql]
----
?"String with a literal 'blackslash' \ character included"
----

You can escape single quotes (`'`) and double quotes (`"`) with a backslash, but
the backslash remains in the resulting string.

[source,eql]
----
?"\""
----

[NOTE]
====
Raw strings cannot contain only a single backslash. Additionally, raw strings
cannot end in an odd number of backslashes.
====

[discrete]
[[eql-syntax-non-alpha-field-names]]
==== Non-alphanumeric field names

Field names containing non-alphanumeric characters, such as underscores (`_`),
dots (`.`), hyphens (`-`), or spaces, must be escaped using backticks (+++`+++).

[source,eql]
----
`my_field`
`my.field`
`my-field`
`my field`
----

[discrete]
[[eql-sequences]]
=== Sequences

You can use EQL sequences to describe and match an ordered series of events.
Each item in a sequence is an event category and event condition,
surrounded by square brackets. Events are listed in ascending chronological
order, with the most recent event listed last.

[source,eql]
----
sequence
  [ event_category_1 where condition_1 ]
  [ event_category_2 where condition_2 ]
  ...
----

.*Example*
[%collapsible]
====
The following EQL sequence query matches this series of ordered events:

. Start with an event with:
+
--
* An event category of `file`
* A `file.extension` of `exe`
--
. Followed by an event with an event category of `process`

[source,eql]
----
sequence
  [ file where file.extension == "exe" ]
  [ process where true ]
----
====

[discrete]
[[eql-with-maxspan-keywords]]
==== `with maxspan` keywords

You can use the `with maxspan` keywords to constrain a sequence to a specified
timespan. All events in a matching sequence must occur within this duration,
starting at the first event's timestamp.

The `maxspan` keyword accepts <<time-units,time value>> arguments.

[source,eql]
----
sequence with maxspan=30s
  [ event_category_1 where condition_1 ] by field_baz
  [ event_category_2 where condition_2 ] by field_bar
  ...
----

.*Example*
[%collapsible]
====
The following sequence query uses a `maxspan` value of `15m` (15 minutes).
Events in a matching sequence must occur within 15 minutes of the first event's
timestamp.

[source,eql]
----
sequence with maxspan=15m
  [ file where file.extension == "exe" ]
  [ process where true ]
----
====

[discrete]
[[eql-by-keyword]]
==== `by` keyword

You can use the `by` keyword with sequences to only match events that share the
same field values. If a field value should be shared across all events, you
can use `sequence by`.

[source,eql]
----
sequence by field_foo
  [ event_category_1 where condition_1 ] by field_baz
  [ event_category_2 where condition_2 ] by field_bar
  ...
----

.*Example*
[%collapsible]
====
The following sequence query uses the `by` keyword to constrain matching events
to:

* Events with the same `user.name` value
* `file` events with a `file.path` value equal to the following `process`
   event's `process.path` value.

[source,eql]
----
sequence
  [ file where file.extension == "exe" ] by user.name, file.path
  [ process where true ] by user.name, process.path
----

Because the `user.name` field is shared across all events in the sequence, it
can be included using `sequence by`. The following sequence is equivalent to the
prior one.

[source,eql]
----
sequence by user.name
  [ file where file.extension == "exe" ] by file.path
  [ process where true ] by process.path
----
====

You can combine the `sequence by` and `with maxspan` keywords to constrain a
sequence by both field values and a timespan.

[source,eql]
----
sequence by field_foo with maxspan=30s
  [ event_category_1 where condition_1 ] by field_baz
  [ event_category_2 where condition_2 ] by field_bar
  ...
----

.*Example*
[%collapsible]
====
The following sequence query uses the `sequence by` keyword and `with maxspan`
keywords to match only a sequence of events that:

* Share the same `user.name` field values
* Occur within `15m` (15 minutes) of the first matching event

[source,eql]
----
sequence by user.name with maxspan=15m
  [ file where file.extension == "exe" ] by file.path
  [ process where true ] by process.path
----
====

[discrete]
[[eql-until-keyword]]
==== `until` keyword

You can use the `until` keyword to specify an expiration event for sequences.
Matching sequences must end before this event, which is not included the
results. If this event occurs within a sequence, the sequence is not considered
a match.

[source,eql]
----
sequence
  [ event_category_1 where condition_1 ]
  [ event_category_2 where condition_2 ]
  ...
until [ event_category_2 where condition_2 ]
----

.*Example*
[%collapsible]
====
The following EQL sequence query uses the `until` keyword to end sequences
before a process termination event. Process termination events have an event
category of `process` and `event.type` value of `termination`.

[source,eql]
----
sequence
  [ file where file.extension == "exe" ]
  [ process where true ]
until [ process where event.type == "termination" ]
----
====

[TIP]
====
The `until` keyword can be helpful when searching for process sequences in
Windows event logs, such as those ingested using
{winlogbeat-ref}/index.html[Winlogbeat].

In Windows, a process ID (PID) is unique only while a process is running. After
a process terminates, its PID can be reused.

You can search for a sequence of events with the same PID value using the `by`
and `sequence by` keywords.

.*Example*
[%collapsible]
=====
The following EQL query uses the `sequence by` keyword to match a sequence of
events that share the same `process.pid` value.

[source,eql]
----
sequence by process.pid
  [ process where process.name == "cmd.exe" ]
  [ process where process.name == "whoami.exe" ]
----
=====

However, due to PID reuse, this can result in a matching sequence that
contains events across unrelated processes. To prevent false positives, you can
use the `until` keyword to end matching sequences before a process termination
event.

.*Example*
[%collapsible]
=====
The following EQL query uses the `until` keyword to end sequences before
`process` events with an `event.type` of `termination`. These events indicate a
process has been terminated.

[source,eql]
----
sequence by process.pid
  [ process where process.name == "cmd.exe" ]
  [ process where process.name == "whoami.exe" ]
until [ process where event.type == "termination" ]
----
=====

[discrete]
[[eql-functions]]
=== Functions

{es} supports several of EQL's built-in functions. You can use these functions
to convert data types, perform math, manipulate strings, and more.

For a list of supported functions, see <<eql-function-ref>>.

[TIP]
====
Using functions in EQL queries can result in slower search speeds. If you
often use functions to transform indexed data, you can speed up search by making
these changes during indexing instead. However, that often means slower index
speeds.

.*Example*
[%collapsible]
=====
An index contains the `file.path` field. `file.path` contains the full path to a
file, including the file extension.

When running EQL searches, users often use the `endsWith` function with the
`file.path` field to match file extensions:

[source,eql]
----
file where endsWith(file.path,".exe") or endsWith(file.path,".dll")
----

While this works, it can be repetitive to write and can slow search speeds. To
speed up search, you can do the following instead:

. <<indices-put-mapping,Add a new field>>, `file.extension`, to the index. The
  `file.extension` field will contain only the file extension from the
  `file.path` field.
. Use an <<ingest,ingest pipeline>> containing the <<grok-processor,`grok`>>
  processor or another preprocessor tool to extract the file extension from the
  `file.path` field before indexing.
. Index the extracted file extension to the `file.extension` field.

These changes may slow indexing but allow for faster searches. Users
can use the `file.extension` field instead of multiple `endsWith` function
calls:

[source,eql]
----
file where file.extension in ("exe", "dll")
----
=====

We recommend testing and benchmarking any indexing changes before deploying them
in production. See <<tune-for-indexing-speed>> and <<tune-for-search-speed>>.
====

[discrete]
[[eql-pipes]]
=== Pipes

EQL pipes filter, aggregate, and post-process events returned by
an EQL query. You can use pipes to narrow down EQL query results or make them
more specific.

Pipes are delimited using the pipe (`|`) character.

[source,eql]
----
event_category where condition | pipe
----

.*Example*
[%collapsible]
====
The following EQL query uses the `tail` pipe to return only the 10 most recent
events matching the query.

[source,eql]
----
authentication where agent.id == 4624
| tail 10
----
====

You can pass the output of a pipe to another pipe. This lets you use multiple
pipes with a single query.

For a list of supported pipes, see <<eql-pipe-ref>>.
