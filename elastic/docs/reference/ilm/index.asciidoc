= {ilm-init}: Manage the index lifecycle

[partintro]
--
You can configure {ilm} ({ilm-init}) policies to automatically manage indices according to
your performance, resiliency, and retention requirements. 
For example, you could use {ilm-init} to:

* Spin up a new index when an index reaches a certain size or number of documents
* Create a new index each day, week, or month and archive previous ones
* Delete stale indices to enforce data retention standards

When you enable {ilm} for {beats} or the {ls} {es} output plugin, 
{ilm-init} is configured automatically. 
You can modify the default policies through {kib} Management or the {ilm-init} APIs.

[TIP]
To automatically back up your indices and manage snapshots, 
use <<getting-started-snapshot-lifecycle-management,snapshot lifecycle policies>>.
