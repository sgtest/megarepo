[[ilm-searchable-snapshot]]
=== Searchable snapshot

beta::[]

Phases allowed: hot, cold.

Takes a snapshot of the managed index in the configured repository
and mounts it as a searchable snapshot.
If the managed index is part of a <<data-streams, data stream>>,
the mounted index replaces the original index in the data stream.

To use the `searchable_snapshot` action in the `hot` phase, the `rollover`
action *must* be present. If no rollover action is configured, {ilm-init}
will reject the policy.

IMPORTANT: If the `searchable_snapshot` action is used in the `hot` phase the
subsequent phases cannot define any of the `shrink`, `forcemerge`, `freeze` or
`searchable_snapshot` (also available in the cold phase) actions.

[NOTE]
This action cannot be performed on a data stream's write index. Attempts to do
so will fail. To convert the index to a searchable snapshot, first
<<manually-roll-over-a-data-stream,manually roll over>> the data stream. This
creates a new write index. Because the index is no longer the stream's write
index, the action can then convert it to a searchable snapshot.
Using a policy that makes use of the <<ilm-rollover, rollover>> action
in the hot phase will avoid this situation and the need for a manual rollover for future
managed indices.

By default, this snapshot is deleted by the <<ilm-delete, delete action>> in the delete phase.
To keep the snapshot, set `delete_searchable_snapshot` to `false` in the delete action.

==== Options

`snapshot_repository`::
(Required, string)
Specifies where to store the snapshot. 
See <<snapshots-register-repository>> for more information.

`force_merge_index`::
(Optional, Boolean)
Force merges the managed index to one segment.
Defaults to `true`.
If the managed index was already force merged using the
<<ilm-forcemerge, force merge action>> in a previous action
the `searchable snapshot` action force merge step will be a no-op.

[NOTE]
The `forcemerge` action is best effort. It might happen that some of
the shards are relocating, in which case they will not be merged.
The `searchable-snapshot` action will continue executing even if not all shards
are force merged.
