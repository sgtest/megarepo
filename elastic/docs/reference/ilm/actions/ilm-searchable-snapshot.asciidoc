[[ilm-searchable-snapshot]]
=== Searchable snapshot

Phases allowed: cold.

Takes a snapshot of the managed index in the configured repository
and mounts it as a searchable snapshot.
If the managed index is part of a <<data-streams, data stream>>,
the mounted index replaces the original index in the data stream.

[NOTE]
This action cannot be performed on a data stream's write index. Attempts to do
so will fail. To convert the index to a searchable snapshot, first
<<manually-roll-over-a-data-stream,manually roll over>> the data stream. This
creates a new write index. Because the index is no longer the stream's write
index, the action can then convert it to a searchable snapshot.
Using a policy that makes use of the <<ilm-rollover, rollover>> action
in the hot phase will avoid this situation and the need for a manual rollover for future
managed indices.

By default, this snapshot is deleted by the <<ilm-delete-action, delete action>> in the delete phase.
To keep the snapshot, set `delete_searchable_snapshot` to `false` in the delete action.
