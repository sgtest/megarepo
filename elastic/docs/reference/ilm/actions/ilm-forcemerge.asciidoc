=== Force merge

Phases allowed: hot, warm.

NOTE: The index is made read-only when this action is run.
See <<dynamic-index-settings,`index.blocks.write`>>.

NOTE: If the `forcemerge` action is used in the `hot` phase, the `rollover` action *must* be preset.
{ilm-init} validates this predicate and will refuse a policy with a forcemerge in the hot phase without a
rollover action.

The force merge action <<indices-forcemerge,force merges>> the index into a
specified maximum number of <<indices-segments,segments>>.

[[ilm-forcemerge-options]]
==== Force merge options

`max_num_segments`::
(Required, integer) 
The number of segments to merge to. To fully merge the index, set it to `1`

`codec`::
(Optional, string)   
Use the `best_compression` codec. Valid values: `best_compression`.
+
[WARNING]
======
Setting `"codec": "best_compression"` in the {ilm-init} forcemerge action causes {ilm-int} to
<<indices-close,close>> and then <<indices-open-close,re-open>> the index prior to the forcemerge.
During this time, the index is unavailable for both read and write operations.
