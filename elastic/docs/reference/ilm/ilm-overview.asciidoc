You can create and apply {ilm-cap} ({ilm-init}) policies to automatically manage your indices 
according to your performance, resiliency, and retention requirements. 
Index lifecycle policies can trigger actions such as:

* **Rollover** - 
include::../glossary.asciidoc[tag=rollover-def-short]
* **Shrink** - 
include::../glossary.asciidoc[tag=shrink-def-short]
* **Force merge** - 
include::../glossary.asciidoc[tag=force-merge-def-short]
* **Freeze** -
include::../glossary.asciidoc[tag=freeze-def-short]
* **Delete** - Permanently remove an index, including all of its data and metadata.

{ilm-init} makes it easier to manage indices in hot-warm-cold architectures,
which are common when you're working with time-series data such as logs and metrics.

You can specify:

* The maximum size, number of documents, or age at which you want to roll over to a new index.
* The point at which the index is no longer being updated and the number of
primary shards can be reduced.
* When to force a merge to permanently remove documents marked for deletion.
* The point at which the index can be moved to less performant hardware.
* The point at which the availability is not as critical and the number of
replicas can be reduced.
* When the index can be safely deleted.

For example, if you are indexing metrics data from a fleet of ATMs into
Elasticsearch, you might define a policy that says:

. When the index reaches 50GB, roll over to a new index.
. Move the old index into the warm stage, mark it read only, and shrink it down
to a single shard.
. After 7 days, move the index into the cold stage and move it to less expensive
hardware.
. Delete the index once the required 30 day retention period is reached.

[IMPORTANT]
===========================
To use {ilm-init}, all nodes in a cluster must run the same version. 
Although it might be possible to create and apply policies in a mixed-version cluster, 
there is no guarantee they will work as intended.
Attempting to use a policy that contains actions that aren't
supported on all nodes in a cluster will cause errors.
