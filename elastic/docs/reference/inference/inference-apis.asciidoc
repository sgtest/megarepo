== {infer-cap} APIs

experimental[]

IMPORTANT: The {infer} APIs enable you to use certain services, such as ELSER, 
OpenAI, or Hugging Face, in your cluster. This is not the same feature that you 
can use on an ML node with custom {ml} models. If you want to train and use your 
own model, use the <<ml-df-trained-models-apis>>.

You can use the following APIs to manage {infer} models and perform {infer}:

* <<delete-inference-api>>
* <<get-inference-api>>
* <<post-inference-api>>
* <<put-inference-api>>
