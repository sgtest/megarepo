[[cat-thread-pool]]
== cat thread pool

The `thread_pool` command shows cluster wide thread pool statistics per node. By default the active, queue and rejected
statistics are returned for all thread pools.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_cat/thread_pool
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

Which looks like:

[source,txt]
--------------------------------------------------
node-0 analyze             0 0 0
node-0 fetch_shard_started 0 0 0
node-0 fetch_shard_store   0 0 0
node-0 flush               0 0 0
node-0 force_merge         0 0 0
node-0 generic             0 0 0
node-0 get                 0 0 0
node-0 listener            0 0 0
node-0 management          1 0 0
node-0 refresh             0 0 0
node-0 search              0 0 0
node-0 snapshot            0 0 0
node-0 warmer              0 0 0
node-0 write               0 0 0
--------------------------------------------------
// TESTRESPONSE[s/\d+/\\d+/ _cat]

The first column is the node name

[source,txt]
--------------------------------------------------
node_name
node-0
--------------------------------------------------

The second column is the thread pool name
[source,txt]
--------------------------------------------------

fetch_shard_store
flush
force_merge

get
listener
management

--------------------------------------------------


The next three columns show the active, queue, and rejected statistics for each thread pool

The cat thread pool API accepts a `thread_pool_patterns` URL parameter for specifying a
comma-separated list of regular expressions to match thread pool names.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_cat/thread_pool/generic?v&h=id,name,active,rejected,completed
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

which looks like:

[source,txt]
--------------------------------------------------
id                     name    active rejected completed
0EWUhXeBQtaVGlexUeVwMg generic      0        0        70
--------------------------------------------------
// TESTRESPONSE[s/0EWUhXeBQtaVGlexUeVwMg/[\\w-]+/ s/\d+/\\d+/ _cat]

Here the host columns and the active, rejected and completed suggest thread pool statistics are displayed.

All <<modules-threadpool,built-in thread pools>> and custom thread pools are available.

==== Thread Pool Fields

For each thread pool, you can load details about it by using the field names
in the table below.

[cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Field Name |Alias |Description
|`type` |`t` |The current (*) type of thread pool (`fixed` or `scaling`)
|`active` |`a` |The number of active threads in the current thread pool
|`pool_size` |`psz` |The number of threads in the current thread pool
|`queue` |`q` |The number of tasks in the queue for the current thread pool
|`queue_size` |`qs` |The maximum number of tasks permitted in the queue for the current thread pool
|`rejected` |`r` |The number of tasks rejected by the thread pool executor
|`largest` |`l` |The highest number of active threads in the current thread pool
|`completed` |`c` |The number of tasks completed by the thread pool executor
|`core` |`cr` |The configured core number of active threads allowed in the current thread pool
|`max` |`mx` |The configured maximum number of active threads allowed in the current thread pool
|`size` |`sz` |The configured fixed number of active threads allowed in the current thread pool
|`keep_alive` |`k` |The configured keep alive time for threads

=== Other Fields

In addition to details about each thread pool, it is also convenient to get an
understanding of where those thread pools reside. As such, you can request
other details like the `ip` of the responding node(s).

[cols="<,<,<",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|Field Name |Alias |Description
|`node_id` |`id` |The unique node ID
|`ephemeral_id`|`eid` |The ephemeral node ID
|`pid` |`p` |The process ID of the running node
|`host` |`h` |The hostname for the current node
|`ip` |`i` |The IP address for the current node
|`port` |`po` |The bound transport port for the current node
|=======================================================================
