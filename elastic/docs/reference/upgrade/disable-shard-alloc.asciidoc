When you shut down a node, the allocation process waits for one minute
before starting to replicate the shards on that node to other nodes
in the cluster, causing a lot of wasted I/O. You can avoid racing the clock
by disabling allocation before shutting down the node:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent": {
    "cluster.routing.allocation.enable": "none"
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
