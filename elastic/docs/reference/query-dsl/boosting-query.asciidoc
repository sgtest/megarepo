=== Boosting Query

The `boosting` query can be used to effectively demote results that
match a given query. Unlike the "NOT" clause in bool query, this still
selects documents that contain undesirable terms, but reduces their
overall score.

It accepts a `positive` query and a `negative` query.
Only documents that match the `positive` query will be included
in the results list, but documents that also match the `negative` query
will be downgraded by multiplying the original `_score` of the document
with the `negative_boost`.
