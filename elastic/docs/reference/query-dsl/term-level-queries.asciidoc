[[term-level-queries]]
== Term level queries

While the <<full-text-queries,full text queries>> will analyze the query
string before executing, the _term-level queries_ operate on the exact terms
that are stored in the inverted index.

These queries are usually used for structured data like numbers, dates, and
enums, rather than full text fields.  Alternatively, they allow you to craft
low-level queries, foregoing the analysis process.

The queries in this group are:

<<query-dsl-term-query,`term` query>>::

    Find documents which contain the exact term specified in the field
    specified.

<<query-dsl-terms-query,`terms` query>>::

    Find documents which contain any of the exact terms specified in the field
    specified.

<<query-dsl-terms-set-query,`terms_set` query>>::

    Find documents which match with one or more of the specified terms. The
    number of terms that must match depend on the specified minimum should
    match field or script.

<<query-dsl-range-query,`range` query>>::

    Find documents where the field specified contains values (dates, numbers,
    or strings) in the range specified.

<<query-dsl-exists-query,`exists` query>>::

    Find documents where the field specified contains any non-null value.

<<query-dsl-prefix-query,`prefix` query>>::

    Find documents where the field specified contains terms which begin with
    the exact prefix specified.

<<query-dsl-wildcard-query,`wildcard` query>>::

    Find documents where the field specified contains terms which match the
    pattern specified, where the pattern supports single character wildcards
    (`?`) and multi-character wildcards (`*`)

<<query-dsl-regexp-query,`regexp` query>>::

    Find documents where the field specified contains terms which match the
    <<regexp-syntax,regular expression>> specified.

<<query-dsl-fuzzy-query,`fuzzy` query>>::

    Find documents where the field specified contains terms which are fuzzily
    similar to the specified term.  Fuzziness is measured as a
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance[Levenshtein edit distance]
    of 1 or 2.

<<query-dsl-type-query,`type` query>>::

    Find documents of the specified type.

<<query-dsl-ids-query,`ids` query>>::

    Find documents with the specified type and IDs.
