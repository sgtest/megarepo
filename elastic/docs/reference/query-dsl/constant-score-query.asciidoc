=== Constant Score Query

A query that wraps another query and simply returns a
constant score equal to the query boost for every document in the
filter. Maps to Lucene `ConstantScoreQuery`.

Filter clauses are executed in <<query-filter-context,filter context>>,
meaning that scoring is ignored and clauses are considered for caching.
