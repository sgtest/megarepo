= Configuring {anomaly-detect} alerts

{anomaly-detect-cap} alerts run scheduled checks on an {anomaly-job} or a group 
of jobs to detect anomalies with certain conditions. If an anomaly meets the 
conditions, the alert triggers the defined action. For example, you can create 
an alert that checks an {anomaly-job} every fifteen minutes for critical 
anomalies and notifies you in an email. This page helps you to configure an 
{anomaly-detect} alert. To learn more about alerts in the {stack}, refer to 
{kibana-ref}/alerting-getting-started.html#alerting-getting-started[Alerting and Actions].


[[creating-anomaly-alerts]]
== Creating an alert

You can create {anomaly-detect} alerts in the {anomaly-job} wizard after you 
start the job, from the job list, or under **{stack-manage-app} > 
{alerts-ui}**. On the *Create alert* window, select *{anomaly-detect-cap} alert* 
under the {ml-cap} section, then give a name to the alert and optionally provide 
tags.

Specify the time interval for the alert to check detected anomalies. It is 
recommended to select an interval that is close to the bucket span of the 
associated job. You can also select a notification option by using the _Notify_ 
selector. For more details, refer to the documentation of
{kibana-ref}/defining-alerts.html#defining-alerts-general-details[general alert details].

NOTE: {anomaly-detect-cap} alerts handle duplications. If you set an interval 
that makes the alert check the same bucket multiple times and the bucket 
contains an anomaly that meets the alert conditions, the configured action 
is triggered only once.

Select the {anomaly-job} or the group of {anomaly-jobs} that is checked by the 
alert. If you assign additional jobs to the group, the alert automatically 
checks the new jobs the next time when the alert runs.

You can select the result type of the {anomaly-job} that triggers the alert. 
In particular, you can create alerts based on bucket, record, or influencer 
results.

For each alert, you can configure the `anomaly_score` that triggers it. The 
`anomaly_score` indicates the significance of a given anomaly compared to 
previous anomalies. The default severity threshold is 75 which means every 
anomaly with an `anomaly_score` of 75 or higher triggers the alert.

You can also test the configured conditions against your existing data and check 
the sample results by providing a valid interval for your data. The generated 
preview contains the number of potentially created alert instances during the 
relative time range you defined.


[[defining-actions]]
== Defining actions

As a next step, connect your alert to actions that use supported built-in 
integrations. Actions are {kib} services or third-party integrations that run 
when the alert conditions are met.

For example, you can choose _Slack_ as an action type and configure it to send a 
message to a channel you selected. You can also create an index connector that 
writes the JSON object you configure to a specific index. It's also possible to 
customize the notification messages. A list of variables is available to include 
in the message, like job ID, anomaly score, time, or top influencers.

After you save the configurations, the alert appears in the _Alerts and 
Actions_ list where you can check its status and see the overview of its 
configuration information.
