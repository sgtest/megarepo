Upgrades an {anomaly-detect} model snapshot to the latest major version.

== {api-request-title}

`POST _ml/anomaly_detectors/<job_id>/model_snapshots/<snapshot_id>/_upgrade`

[[ml-upgrade-job-model-snapshot-prereqs]]
== {api-prereq-title}

* If the {es} {security-features} are enabled, you must have `manage_ml` or
`manage` cluster privileges to use this API. See
<<security-privileges>> and {ml-docs-setup-privileges}.
* The upgraded snapshot must have a version matching the previous major version.
* The upgraded snapshot must NOT be the current {anomaly-job} snapshot.

[[ml-upgrade-job-model-snapshot-desc]]
== {api-description-title}

Over time, older snapshot formats are deprecated and removed. {anomaly-jobs-cap}
support only snapshots that are from the current or previous major version.

This API provides a means to upgrade a snapshot to the current major version.
This aids in preparing the cluster for an upgrade to the next major version.

Only one snapshot per {anomaly-job} can be upgraded at a time and the upgraded
snapshot cannot be the current snapshot of the {anomaly-job}.

`<job_id>`::
(Required, string)

`<snapshot_id>`::
(Required, string)
include::{es-repo-dir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=snapshot-id]

`timeout`::
  (Optional, time) Controls the time to wait for the request to complete. The default
  value is 30 minutes.

`wait_for_completion`::
(Optional, boolean) When true, the API won't respond until the upgrade is complete. Otherwise,
it responds as soon as the upgrade task is assigned to a node. Default is false.

`node`::
  (string) The ID of the assigned node for the upgrade task if it is still running.

`completed`::
  (boolean) When true, this means the task is complete. When false, it is still running.
