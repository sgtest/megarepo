Starts a new trained model deployment.

[[start-trained-model-deployment-request]]
== {api-request-title}

`POST _ml/trained_models/<model_id>/deployent/_start`

[[start-trained-model-deployment-prereq]]
== {api-prereq-title}
Requires the `manage_ml` cluster privilege. This privilege is included in the
`machine_learning_admin` built-in role.

[[start-trained-model-deployment-desc]]
== {api-description-title}

Currently only `pytorch` models are supported for deployment. When deployed,
the model attempts allocation to every machine learning node.

[[start-trained-model-deployment-path-params]]
== {api-path-parms-title}

`<model_id>`::
(Required, string)
include::{es-repo-dir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=model-id]

[[start-trained-model-deployment-query-params]]
== {api-query-parms-title}

`timeout`::
(Optional, time)
Controls the amount of time to wait for the model to deploy. Defaults
to 20 seconds.

`wait_for`::
(Optional, string)
Specifies the allocation status to wait for before returning. Defaults to
`started`. The value `starting` indicates deployment is starting but not yet on
any node. The value `started` indicates the model has started on at least one
node. The value `fully_allocated` indicates the deployment has started on all
valid nodes.

`model_threads`::
(Optional, integer)
Indicates how many threads are used when sending inference requests to
the model. Increasing this value generally increases the throughput. Defaults to
1.

`inference_threads`::
(Optional, integer)
Sets the number of threads used by the inference process. This generally increases
the inference speed. The inference process is a compute-bound process; any number 
greater than the number of available CPU cores on the machine does not increase the 
inference speed.
Defaults to 1.

`queue_capacity`::
(Optional, integer)
Controls how many inference requests are allowed in the queue at a time. Once the
number of requests exceeds this value, new requests are rejected with a 429 error.
Defaults to 1024.

[[start-trained-model-deployment-example]]
== {api-examples-title}

The following example starts a new deployment for a
`elastic__distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-conll03-english` trained model:
