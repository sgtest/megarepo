Starts a new trained model deployment.

[[start-trained-model-deployment-request]]
== {api-request-title}

`POST _ml/trained_models/<model_id>/deployent/_start`

[[start-trained-model-deployment-prereq]]
== {api-prereq-title}
Requires the `manage_ml` cluster privilege. This privilege is included in the
`machine_learning_admin` built-in role.

[[start-trained-model-deployment-desc]]
== {api-description-title}

Currently only `pytorch` models are supported for deployment. When deployed,
the model attempts allocation to every machine learning node.

[[start-trained-model-deployment-path-params]]
== {api-path-parms-title}

`<model_id>`::
(Required, string)
include::{es-repo-dir}/ml/ml-shared.asciidoc[tag=model-id]

[[start-trained-model-deployment-query-params]]
== {api-query-parms-title}

`timeout`::
(Optional, time)
Controls the amount of time to wait for the model to deploy. Defaults
to 20 seconds.

`wait_for`::
(Optional, string)
Specifies the allocation status to wait for before returning. Defaults to
`started`. The value `starting` indicates deployment is starting but not yet on
any node. The value `started` indicates the model has started on at least one
node. The value `fully_allocated` indicates the deployment has started on all
valid nodes.

[[start-trained-model-deployment-example]]
== {api-examples-title}

The following example starts a new deployment for a
`elastic__d`istilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-conll03-english` trained model:

--------------------------------------------------
POST _ml/trained_models/elastic__distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-conll03-english/deployment/_start?wait_for=started&timeout=1m
--------------------------------------------------
// TEST[skip:TBD]

The API returns the following results:
