=== Close Jobs API
++++
<titleabbrev>Close Jobs</titleabbrev>
++++

Closes one or more jobs.
A job can be opened and closed multiple times throughout its lifecycle.

A closed job cannot receive data or perform analysis
operations, but you can still explore and navigate results.


==== Request

`POST _xpack/ml/anomaly_detectors/<job_id>/_close` +

`POST _xpack/ml/anomaly_detectors/<job_id>,<job_id>/_close` +

`POST _xpack/ml/anomaly_detectors/_all/_close` +


==== Description

You can close multiple jobs in a single API request by using a group name, a
comma-separated list of jobs, or a wildcard expression. You can close all jobs
by using `_all` or by specifying `*` as the `<job_id>`.

When you close a job, it runs housekeeping tasks such as pruning the model history,
flushing buffers, calculating final results and persisting the model snapshots.
Depending upon the size of the job, it could take several minutes to close and
the equivalent time to re-open.

After it is closed, the job has a minimal overhead on the cluster except for
maintaining its meta data. Therefore it is a best practice to close jobs that
are no longer required to process data.

When a {dfeed} that has a specified end date stops, it automatically closes
the job.

NOTE: If you use the `force` query parameter, the request returns without performing
the associated actions such as flushing buffers and persisting the model snapshots.
Therefore, do not use this parameter if you want the job to be in a consistent state
after the close job API returns.  The `force` query parameter should only be used in
situations where the job has already failed, or where you are not interested in
results the job might have recently produced or might produce in the future.


==== Path Parameters

`job_id`::
  (string) Identifier for the job. It can be a job identifier, a group name, or
  a wildcard expression.


==== Query Parameters

`force`::
  (boolean) Use to close a failed job, or to forcefully close a job which has not
  responded to its initial close request.

`timeout`::
  (time units) Controls the time to wait until a job has closed.
  The default value is 30 minutes.


==== Authorization

You must have `manage_ml`, or `manage` cluster privileges to use this API.
For more information, see {xpack-ref}/security-privileges.html[Security Privileges].


==== Examples

The following example closes the `total-requests` job:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
POST _xpack/ml/anomaly_detectors/total-requests/_close
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[skip:setup:server_metrics_openjob]

When the job is closed, you receive the following results:
[source,js]
----
{
  "closed": true
}
----
// TESTRESPONSE
