== Delete a snapshot

[source,console]

PUT /_snapshot/my_backup
{
  "type": "fs",
  "settings": {
    "location": "my_backup_location"
  }
}

Use the <<delete-snapshot-api,delete snapshot API>> to delete a snapshot
from the repository:

[source,console]
----
DELETE /_snapshot/my_backup/snapshot_1
----

When a snapshot is deleted from a repository, {es} deletes all files associated with the
snapshot that are not in-use by other snapshots.

If the delete snapshot operation starts while the snapshot is being
created, the snapshot process halts and all files created as part of the snapshotting process are
removed. Use the <<delete-snapshot-api,Delete snapshot API>> to cancel long running snapshot operations that were
started by mistake.

To delete multiple snapshots from a repository, separate snapshot names by commas or use wildcards:

[source,console]
-----------------------------------
DELETE /_snapshot/my_backup/snapshot_2,snapshot_3
DELETE /_snapshot/my_backup/snap*
-----------------------------------
