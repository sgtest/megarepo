. Install and start https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker
Desktop].

. Run:
+
[source,sh,subs="attributes"]
----
docker network create elastic
docker pull {docker-repo}:{version}
docker run --name es01 --net elastic -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -it {docker-image}
----

When you start {es} for the first time, the following security configuration 
occurs automatically:
+
--
* <<elasticsearch-security-certificates,Certificates and keys>> are generated
for the transport and HTTP layers.
* The Transport Layer Security (TLS) configuration settings are written to
`elasticsearch.yml`.
* A password is generated for the `elastic` user.
* An enrollment token is generated for {kib}.

NOTE: You might need to scroll back a bit in the terminal to view the password 
and enrollment token.
--

. Copy the generated password and enrollment token and save them in a secure 
location. These values are shown only when you start {es} for the first time.
You'll use these to enroll {kib} with your {es} cluster and log in.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you need to reset the password for the `elastic` user or other
built-in users, run the <<reset-password,`elasticsearch-reset-password`>> tool.
To generate new enrollment tokens for {kib} or {es} nodes, run the
<<create-enrollment-token,`elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token`>> tool.
These tools are available in the {es} `bin` directory.
