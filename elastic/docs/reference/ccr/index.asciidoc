The {ccr} (CCR) feature enables replication of indices in remote clusters to a 
local cluster. This functionality can be used in some common production use
cases:

* Disaster recovery in case a primary cluster fails. A secondary cluster can
  serve as a hot backup
* Geo-proximity so that reads can be served locally

This guide provides an overview of {ccr}:
