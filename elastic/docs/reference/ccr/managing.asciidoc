[[ccr-managing]]
=== Manage {ccr}
Use the following information to manage {ccr} tasks, such as inspecting
replication progress, pausing and resuming replication, recreating a follower
index, and terminating replication.

[[ccr-access-ccr]]
To start using {ccr}, access {kib} and go to
*Management > Stack Management*. In the side navigation, select
*Cross-Cluster Replication*.

[[ccr-inspect-progress]]
==== Inspect replication statistics
To inspect the progress of replication for a follower index and view
detailed shard statistics, <<ccr-access-ccr,access Cross-Cluster Replication>> and choose the *Follower indices* tab.

Select the name of the follower index you want to view replication details
for. The slide-out panel shows settings and replication statistics for the
follower index, including read and write operations that are managed by the
follower shard.

To view more detailed statistics, click *View in Index Management*, and
then select the name of the follower index in Index Management.
Open the tabs for detailed statistics about the follower index.

[%collapsible]
.API example
====
Use the <<ccr-get-follow-stats,get follower stats API>> to inspect replication
progress at the shard level. This API provides insight into the read and writes
managed by the follower shard. The API also reports read exceptions that can be
retried and fatal exceptions that require user intervention.
====

[[ccr-pause-replication]]
==== Pause and resume replication
To pause and resume replication of the leader index, <<ccr-access-ccr,access Cross-Cluster Replication>> and choose the *Follower indices* tab.

Select the follower index you want to pause and choose *Manage > Pause Replication*. The follower index status changes to Paused.

To resume replication, select the follower index and choose
*Resume replication*.

[%collapsible]
.API example
====
You can pause replication with the
<<ccr-post-pause-follow,pause follower API>> and then later resume
replication with the <<ccr-post-resume-follow,resume follower API>>.
Using these APIs in tandem enables you to adjust the read and write parameters
on the follower shard task if your initial configuration is not suitable for
your use case.
====

[[ccr-recreate-follower-index]]
==== Recreate a follower index
When a document is updated or deleted, the underlying operation is retained in
the Lucene index for a period of time defined by the
<<ccr-index-soft-deletes-retention-period,`index.soft_deletes.retention_lease.period`>> parameter. You configure
this setting on the <<ccr-leader-requirements,leader index>>.

When a follower index starts, it acquires a retention lease from
the leader index. This lease informs the leader that it should not allow a soft
delete to be pruned until either the follower indicates that it has received
the operation, or until the lease expires.

If a follower index falls sufficiently behind a leader and cannot
replicate operations, {es} reports an `indices[].fatal_exception` error. To
resolve the issue, recreate the follower index. When the new follow index
starts, the <<ccr-remote-recovery, remote recovery>> process recopies the
Lucene segment files from the leader.

IMPORTANT: Recreating the follower index is a destructive action. All existing
Lucene segment files are deleted on the cluster containing the follower index.

To recreate a follower index,
<<ccr-access-ccr,access Cross-Cluster Replication>> and choose the
*Follower indices* tab.

[role="screenshot"]
image::images/ccr-follower-index.png["The Cross-Cluster Replication page in {kib}"]

Select the follower index and pause replication. When the follower index status
changes to Paused, reselect the follower index and choose to unfollow the
leader index.

The follower index will be converted to a standard index and will no longer
display on the Cross-Cluster Replication page.

In the side navigation, choose *Index Management*. Select the follower index
from the previous steps and close the follower index.

You can then <<ccr-getting-started-follower-index,recreate the follower index>>
to restart the replication process.

[%collapsible]
.Use the API
====
Use the <<ccr-post-pause-follow,pause follow API>> to pause the replication
process. Then, close the follower index and recreate it. For example:

[source,console]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
POST /follower_index/_ccr/pause_follow

POST /follower_index/_close

PUT /follower_index/_ccr/follow?wait_for_active_shards=1
{
  "remote_cluster" : "remote_cluster",
  "leader_index" : "leader_index"
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------
// TEST[setup:remote_cluster_and_leader_index_and_follower_index teardown:pause_follow]
====

[[ccr-terminate-replication]]
==== Terminate replication
You can unfollow a leader index to terminate replication and convert the
follower index to a standard index.

<<ccr-access-ccr,Access Cross-Cluster Replication>> and choose the
*Follower indices* tab.

Select the follower index and pause replication. When the follower index status
changes to Paused, reselect the follower index and choose to unfollow the
leader index.

The follower index will be converted to a standard index and will no longer
display on the Cross-Cluster Replication page.

You can then choose *Index Management*, select the follower index
from the previous steps, and close the follower index.

[%collapsible]
.Use the API
====
You can terminate replication with the
<<ccr-post-unfollow,unfollow API>>. This API converts a follower index
to a standard (non-follower) index.
