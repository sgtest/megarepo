=== Reactive storage decider

The reactive storage decider (`reactive_storage`) calculates the storage required to contain
the current data set. It signals that additional storage capacity is necessary
when existing capacity has been exceeded (reactively).

The reactive storage decider is enabled for all policies governing data nodes and has no configuration options.
