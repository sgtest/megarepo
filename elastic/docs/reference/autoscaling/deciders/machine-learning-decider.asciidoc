=== Machine learning decider

The {ml} decider (`ml`) calculates the memory required to run
{ml} jobs created by users.

The {ml} decider is enabled for policies governing `ml` nodes.

NOTE: For {ml} jobs to open when the cluster is not appropriately
scaled, `xpack.ml.max_lazy_ml_nodes` should be set to the largest
number of possible {ml} jobs (see <<advanced-ml-settings>>). In
{ess} this is already handled.

==== Configuration settings

Both `num_anomaly_jobs_in_queue` and `num_analytics_jobs_in_queue`
are designed to be used to delay a scale-up event. They indicate how many jobs
of that type can be unassigned from a node due to the cluster being
too small. Both settings are only considered for jobs that could
eventually be fully opened given the current scale. If a job is too
large for any node size or if a job couldn't ever be assigned without
user intervention (for example, a user calling `_stop` against a real-time 
{anomaly-job}), the numbers are ignored for that particular job.

`num_anomaly_jobs_in_queue`::
(Optional, integer)
Number of queued anomaly jobs to allow. Defaults to `0`.

`num_analytics_jobs_in_queue`::
(Optional, integer)
Number of queued analytics jobs to allow. Defaults to `0`.

`down_scale_delay`::
(Optional, <<time-units,time value>>)
Delay before scaling down. Defaults to 1 hour. If a scale down is possible
for the entire time window, then a scale down is requested. If the cluster
requires a scale up during the window, the window is reset.

==== {api-examples-title}

This example puts an autoscaling policy named `my_autoscaling_policy`,
overriding the machine learning decider's configuration.

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT /_autoscaling/policy/my_autoscaling_policy
{
  "roles" : [ "ml" ],
  "deciders": {
    "ml": {
      "num_anomaly_jobs_in_queue": 5,
      "num_analytics_jobs_in_queue": 3,
      "down_scale_delay": "30m"
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// TEST

The API returns the following result:
