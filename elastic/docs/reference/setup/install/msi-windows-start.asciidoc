==== Running Elasticsearch from the command line

Once installed, Elasticsearch can be started from the command line, if not installed as a service
and configured to start when installation completes, as follows:

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
--------------------------------------------
.\bin\elasticsearch.exe
--------------------------------------------

The command line terminal will display output similar to the following:

By default {es} prints its logs to `STDOUT` and to the `<cluster name>.log`
file within `LOGSDIRECTORY`. {es} logs some information while it is starting
up, but once it has finished initializing it will continue to run in the
foreground and won't log anything further until something happens that is worth
recording. While {es} is running you can interact with it through its HTTP
interface which is on port 9200 by default. To stop {es}, press `Ctrl-C`.
