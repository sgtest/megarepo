==== Run {es} from the command line

Run the following command to start {es} from the command line:

[source,sh]
----
./bin/elasticsearch
----

When starting {es} for the first time, security features are enabled and
configured by default. The following security configuration occurs
automatically: 

* Authentication and authorization are enabled, and a password is generated for
the `elastic` built-in superuser.
* Certificates and keys for TLS are generated for the transport and HTTP layer,
and TLS is enabled and configured with these keys and certificates.
* An enrollment token is generated for {kib}, which is valid for 30 minutes.

The password for the `elastic` user and the enrollment token for {kib} are
output to your terminal. For example:

[source,sh]
----
The generated password for the elastic built-in superuser is:
H16Wd=K4dcmgZVA-GE2I

The enrollment token for Kibana instances, valid for the next 30 minutes:

The hex-encoded SHA-256 fingerprint of the generated HTTPS CA DER-encoded certificate:

You can complete the following actions at any time:
Reset the password of the elastic built-in superuser with
'bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic'.

Generate an enrollment token for Kibana instances with
'bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana'.

Generate an enrollment token for Elasticsearch nodes with
'bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s node'.

If you have password-protected the {es} keystore, you will be prompted
to enter the keystore's password. See <<secure-settings>> for more
details.

By default {es} prints its logs to the console (`stdout`) and to the `<cluster
name>.log` file within the <<path-settings,logs directory>>. {es} logs some
information while it is starting, but after it has finished initializing it
will continue to run in the foreground and won't log anything further until
something happens that is worth recording. While {es} is running you can
interact with it through its HTTP interface which is on port `9200` by default.

To stop {es}, press `Ctrl-C`.

NOTE: All scripts packaged with {es} require a version of Bash
that supports arrays and assume that Bash is available at `/bin/bash`.
As such, Bash should be available at this path either directly or via a
symbolic link.

To enroll additional nodes in your cluster, create an enrollment token with the
`elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token` tool. You can then start a node with the `--enrollment-token` parameter so that it
{ref}/configuring-stack-security.html#stack-enroll-nodes[joins an existing cluster].
