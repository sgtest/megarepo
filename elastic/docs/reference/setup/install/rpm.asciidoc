[[rpm]]
=== Install Elasticsearch with RPM

The RPM for Elasticsearch can be <<install-rpm,downloaded from our website>>
or from our  <<rpm-repo,RPM repository>>. It can be used to install
Elasticsearch on any RPM-based system such as OpenSuSE, SLES, Centos, Red Hat,
and Oracle Enterprise.

NOTE: RPM install is not supported on distributions with old versions of RPM,
such as SLES 11 and CentOS 5.  Please see <<zip-targz>> instead.

The latest stable version of Elasticsearch can be found on the
link:/downloads/elasticsearch[Download Elasticsearch] page. Other versions can
be found on the link:/downloads/past-releases[Past Releases page].

NOTE: Elasticsearch requires Java 8 or later. Use the
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[official Oracle distribution]
or an open-source distribution such as http://openjdk.java.net[OpenJDK].

[[rpm-key]]
==== Import the Elasticsearch PGP Key

include::key.asciidoc[]

[source,sh]
-------------------------
rpm --import https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
-------------------------

[[rpm-repo]]
==== Installing from the RPM repository

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="unreleased"]

Version {version} of Elasticsearch has not yet been released.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{release-state}"!="unreleased"]

Create a file called `elasticsearch.repo` in the `/etc/yum.repos.d/` directory
for RedHat based distributions, or in the `/etc/zypp/repos.d/` directory for
OpenSuSE based distributions, containing:

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="released"]

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
--------------------------------------------------
[elasticsearch-{major-version}]
name=Elasticsearch repository for {major-version} packages
baseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/{major-version}/yum
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
enabled=1
autorefresh=1
type=rpm-md
--------------------------------------------------

endif::[]

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="prerelease"]

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
--------------------------------------------------
[elasticsearch-{major-version}]
name=Elasticsearch repository for {major-version} packages
baseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/{major-version}-prerelease/yum
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
enabled=1
autorefresh=1
type=rpm-md
--------------------------------------------------

endif::[]

And your repository is ready for use. You can now install Elasticsearch with one of the following commands:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
sudo yum install elasticsearch <1>
sudo dnf install elasticsearch <2>
sudo zypper install elasticsearch <3>
--------------------------------------------------
<1> Use `yum` on CentOS and older Red Hat based distributions.
<2> Use `dnf` on Fedora and other newer Red Hat distributions.
<3> Use `zypper` on OpenSUSE based distributions

endif::[]

[[install-rpm]]
==== Download and install the RPM manually

ifeval::["{release-state}"=="unreleased"]

Version {version} of Elasticsearch has not yet been released.

endif::[]

ifeval::["{release-state}"!="unreleased"]

The RPM for Elasticsearch v{version} can be downloaded from the website and installed as follows:

["source","sh",subs="attributes"]
--------------------------------------------
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-{version}.rpm
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-{version}.rpm.sha512
shasum -a 512 -c elasticsearch-{version}.rpm.sha512 <1>
sudo rpm --install elasticsearch-{version}.rpm
--------------------------------------------
<1> Compares the SHA of the downloaded RPM and the published checksum, which should output
    `elasticsearch-{version}.rpm: OK`.

endif::[]

ifdef::include-xpack[]
[[rpm-enable-indices]]
==== Enable automatic creation of {xpack} indices

{xpack} will try to automatically create a number of indices within {es}.

[[rpm-running-init]]
==== Running Elasticsearch with SysV `init`

Use the `chkconfig` command to configure Elasticsearch to start automatically
when the system boots up:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
sudo chkconfig --add elasticsearch
--------------------------------------------------

Elasticsearch can be started and stopped using the `service` command:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
sudo -i service elasticsearch start
sudo -i service elasticsearch stop
--------------------------------------------

If Elasticsearch fails to start for any reason, it will print the reason for
failure to STDOUT. Log files can be found in `/var/log/elasticsearch/`.

[[rpm-check-running]]

[[rpm-configuring]]
==== Configuring Elasticsearch

include::etc-elasticsearch.asciidoc[]

The RPM also has a system configuration file (`/etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch`),
which allows you to set the following parameters:

include::sysconfig-file.asciidoc[]

NOTE: Distributions that use `systemd` require that system resource limits be
configured via `systemd` rather than via the `/etc/sysconfig/elasticsearch`
file.  See <<systemd>> for more information.

[[rpm-layout]]
==== Directory layout of RPM

The RPM places config files, logs, and the data directory in the appropriate
locations for an RPM-based system:


[cols="<h,<,<m,<m",options="header",]

| Type | Description | Default Location | Setting
| home
  | Elasticsearch home directory or `$ES_HOME`
  | /usr/share/elasticsearch
