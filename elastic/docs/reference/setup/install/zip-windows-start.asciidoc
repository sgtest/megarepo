==== Running Elasticsearch from the command line

Elasticsearch can be started from the command line as follows:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
.\bin\elasticsearch.bat
--------------------------------------------

If you have password-protected the {es} keystore, you will be prompted to
enter the keystore's password. See <<secure-settings>> for more details.

By default {es} prints its logs to the console (`STDOUT`) and to the `<cluster
name>.log` file within the <<path-settings,logs directory>>. {es} logs some
information while it is starting up, but once it has finished initializing it
will continue to run in the foreground and won't log anything further until
something happens that is worth recording. While {es} is running you can
interact with it through its HTTP interface which is on port 9200 by default.
To stop {es}, press `Ctrl-C`.
