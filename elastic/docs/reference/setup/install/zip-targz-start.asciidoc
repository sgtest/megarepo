==== Running Elasticsearch from the command line

Elasticsearch can be started from the command line as follows:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------
./bin/elasticsearch
--------------------------------------------

By default, Elasticsearch runs in the foreground, prints its logs to the
standard output (`stdout`), and can be stopped by pressing `Ctrl-C`.

NOTE: All scripts packaged with Elasticsearch require a version of Bash
that supports arrays and assume that Bash is available at `/bin/bash`.
As such, Bash should be available at this path either directly or via a
symbolic link.
