== Important Elasticsearch configuration

While Elasticsearch requires very little configuration, there are a number of
settings which need to be considered before going into production.

The following settings *must* be considered before going to production:

* <<path-settings,Path settings>>
* <<cluster-name,Cluster name setting>>
* <<node-name,Node name setting>>
* <<network.host,Network host settings>>
* <<discovery-settings,Discovery settings>>
* <<heap-size,Heap size settings>>
* <<heap-dump-path,JVM heap dump path setting>>
* <<gc-logging,GC logging settings>>
* <<es-tmpdir,Temporary directory settings>>
* <<error-file-path,JVM fatal error log setting>>
