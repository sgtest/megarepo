[[network.host]]
[discrete]
=== Network host setting

By default, {es} only binds to loopback addresses such as `127.0.0.1` and
`[::1]`. This is sufficient to run a cluster of one or more nodes on a single
server for development and testing, but a
<<high-availability-cluster-design,resilient production cluster>> must involve
nodes on other servers. There are many <<modules-network,network settings>> but
usually all you need to configure is `network.host`:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
network.host: 192.168.1.10
--------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: When you provide a value for `network.host`, {es} assumes that you
are moving from development mode to production mode, and upgrades a number of
system startup checks from warnings to exceptions. See the differences between
<<dev-vs-prod,development and production modes>>.
