=== Path settings

{es} writes the data you index to indices and data streams to a `data`
directory. {es} writes its own application logs, which contain information about
cluster health and operations, to a `logs` directory.

For <<targz,macOS `.tar.gz`>>, <<targz,Linux `.tar.gz`>>, and
<<zip-windows,Windows `.zip`>> installations, `data` and `logs` are
subdirectories of `$ES_HOME` by default. However, files in `$ES_HOME` risk
deletion during an upgrade.

In production, we strongly recommend you set the `path.data` and `path.logs` in
`elasticsearch.yml` to locations outside of `$ES_HOME`.

TIP: <<docker,Docker>>, <<deb,Debian>>, <<rpm,RPM>>, <<brew,macOS Homebrew>>,
and <<windows,Windows `.msi`>> installations write data and log to locations
outside of `$ES_HOME` by default.

Supported `path.data` and `path.logs` values vary by platform:

==== Multiple data paths
deprecated::[7.13.0]

If needed, you can specify multiple paths in `path.data`. {es} stores the node's
data across all provided paths but keeps each shard's data on the same path.

{es} does not balance shards across a node's data paths. High disk
usage in a single path can trigger a <<disk-based-shard-allocation,high disk
usage watermark>> for the entire node. If triggered, {es} will not add shards to
the node, even if the nodeâ€™s other paths have available disk space. If you need
additional disk space, we recommend you add a new node rather than additional
data paths.
