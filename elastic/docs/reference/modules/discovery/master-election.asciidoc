=== Master election settings

The following settings control the scheduling of elections.

`cluster.election.initial_timeout`::

    Sets the upper bound on how long a node will wait initially, or after the
    elected master fails, before attempting its first election. This defaults
    to `100ms`.

`cluster.election.back_off_time`::

    Sets the amount to increase the upper bound on the wait before an election
    on each election failure. Note that this is _linear_ backoff. This defaults
    to `100ms`

`cluster.election.max_timeout`::

    Sets the maximum upper bound on how long a node will wait before attempting
    an first election, so that an network partition that lasts for a long time
    does not result in excessively sparse elections. This defaults to `10s`

`cluster.election.duration`::

    Sets how long each election is allowed to take before a node considers it to
    have failed and schedules a retry. This defaults to `500ms`.

==== Joining an elected master

During master election, or when joining an existing formed cluster, a node will
send a join request to the master in order to be officially added to the
cluster. This join process can be configured with the following settings.

`cluster.join.timeout`::

    Sets how long a node will wait after sending a request to join a cluster
    before it considers the request to have failed and retries. Defaults to
    `60s`.
