== Plugins

Plugins are a way to enhance the basic Elasticsearch functionality in a
custom manner. They range from adding custom mapping types, custom
analyzers (in a more built in fashion), custom script engines, custom discovery
and more.

For information about selecting and installing plugins, see
{plugins}/index.html[{es} Plugins and Integrations].

For information about developing your own plugin, see
