[[circuit-breaker]]
=== Circuit breaker settings
[[circuit-breaker-description]]
// tag::circuit-breaker-description-tag[]
{es} contains multiple circuit breakers used to prevent operations from causing an OutOfMemoryError. Each breaker specifies a limit for how much memory it can use. Additionally, there is a parent-level breaker that specifies the total amount of memory that can be used across all breakers.

Except where noted otherwise, these settings can be dynamically updated on a
live cluster with the <<cluster-update-settings,cluster-update-settings>> API.

[[parent-circuit-breaker]]
[discrete]
==== Parent circuit breaker

The parent-level breaker can be configured with the following settings:

`indices.breaker.total.use_real_memory`::
    (<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>)
    Determines whether the parent breaker should take real
    memory usage into account (`true`) or only consider the amount that is
    reserved by child circuit breakers (`false`). Defaults to `true`.

[[indices-breaker-total-limit]]
// tag::indices-breaker-total-limit-tag[]
`indices.breaker.total.limit` {ess-icon}::
    (<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
    Starting limit for overall parent breaker. Defaults to 70% of JVM heap if
    `indices.breaker.total.use_real_memory` is `false`. If `indices.breaker.total.use_real_memory`
    is `true`, defaults to 95% of the JVM heap.
// end::indices-breaker-total-limit-tag[]

[[fielddata-circuit-breaker]]
[discrete]
==== Field data circuit breaker
The field data circuit breaker estimates the heap memory required to load a
field into the <<modules-fielddata,field data cache>>. If loading the field would
cause the cache to exceed a predefined memory limit, the circuit breaker stops the
operation and returns an error.

[[fielddata-circuit-breaker-limit]]
// tag::fielddata-circuit-breaker-limit-tag[]
`indices.breaker.fielddata.limit` {ess-icon}::
    (<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
    Limit for fielddata breaker. Defaults to 40% of JVM heap.
// end::fielddata-circuit-breaker-limit-tag[]

[[fielddata-circuit-breaker-overhead]]
// tag::fielddata-circuit-breaker-overhead-tag[]
`indices.breaker.fielddata.overhead` {ess-icon}::
    (<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
    A constant that all field data estimations are multiplied with to determine a
    final estimation. Defaults to `1.03`.
// end::fielddata-circuit-breaker-overhead-tag[]

[[request-circuit-breaker]]
[discrete]
==== Request circuit breaker

The request circuit breaker allows Elasticsearch to prevent per-request data
structures (for example, memory used for calculating aggregations during a
request) from exceeding a certain amount of memory.

[[request-breaker-limit]]
// tag::request-breaker-limit-tag[]
`indices.breaker.request.limit` {ess-icon}::
    (<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
    Limit for request breaker, defaults to 60% of JVM heap.
// end::request-breaker-limit-tag[]

[[request-breaker-overhead]]
// tag::request-breaker-overhead-tag[]
`indices.breaker.request.overhead` {ess-icon}::
    (<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
    A constant that all request estimations are multiplied with to determine a
    final estimation. Defaults to `1`.
// end::request-breaker-overhead-tag[]

[[in-flight-circuit-breaker]]
[discrete]
==== In flight requests circuit breaker

The in flight requests circuit breaker allows Elasticsearch to limit the memory usage of all
currently active incoming requests on transport or HTTP level from exceeding a certain amount of
memory on a node. The memory usage is based on the content length of the request itself. This
circuit breaker also considers that memory is not only needed for representing the raw request but
also as a structured object which is reflected by default overhead.

`network.breaker.inflight_requests.limit`::
    (<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
    Limit for in flight requests breaker, defaults to 100% of JVM heap. This means that it is bound
    by the limit configured for the parent circuit breaker.

`network.breaker.inflight_requests.overhead`::
    (<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
    A constant that all in flight requests estimations are multiplied with to determine a
    final estimation. Defaults to 2.

[[accounting-circuit-breaker]]
[discrete]
==== Accounting requests circuit breaker

The accounting circuit breaker allows Elasticsearch to limit the memory
usage of things held in memory that are not released when a request is
completed. This includes things like the Lucene segment memory.

`indices.breaker.accounting.limit`::
    (<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
    Limit for accounting breaker, defaults to 100% of JVM heap. This means that it is bound
    by the limit configured for the parent circuit breaker.

`indices.breaker.accounting.overhead`::
    (<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
    A constant that all accounting estimations are multiplied with to determine a
    final estimation. Defaults to 1

[[script-compilation-circuit-breaker]]
[discrete]
==== Script compilation circuit breaker

Slightly different than the previous memory-based circuit breaker, the script
compilation circuit breaker limits the number of inline script compilations
within a period of time.

See the "prefer-parameters" section of the <<modules-scripting-using,scripting>>
documentation for more information.

`script.context.$CONTEXT.max_compilations_rate`::
    (<<dynamic-cluster-setting,Dynamic>>)
    Limit for the number of unique dynamic scripts within a certain interval
    that are allowed to be compiled for a given context. Defaults to `75/5m`,
    meaning 75 every 5 minutes.
