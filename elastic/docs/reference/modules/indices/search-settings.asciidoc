=== Search settings

The following expert settings can be set to manage global search and aggregation
limits.

[[indices-query-bool-max-clause-count]]
`indices.query.bool.max_clause_count`::
(integer)
Maximum number of clauses a Lucene BooleanQuery can contain. Defaults to `1024`.
+
This setting limits the number of clauses a Lucene BooleanQuery can have. The
default of 1024 is quite high and should normally be sufficient. This limit does
not only affect Elasticsearchs `bool` query, but many other queries are rewritten to Lucene's
BooleanQuery internally. The limit is in place to prevent searches from becoming too large
and taking up too much CPU and memory. In case you're considering increasing this setting,
make sure you've exhausted all other options to avoid having to do this. Higher values can lead 
to performance degradations and memory issues, especially in clusters with a high load or 
few resources.

[[search-settings-max-buckets]]
`search.max_buckets`::
(<<cluster-update-settings,Dynamic>>, integer)
Maximum number of <<search-aggregations-bucket,aggregation buckets>> allowed in
a single response. Defaults to `10000`.
+
Requests that attempt to return more than this limit will return an error.
