== SQL Client Applications

Thanks to its <<sql-jdbc, JDBC>> interface, a broad range of third-party applications can use {es}'s SQL capabilities.
This section lists, in alphabetical order, a number of them and their respective configuration - the list however is by no means comprehensive (feel free to https://www.elastic.co/blog/art-of-pull-request[submit a PR] to improve it):
as long as the app can use the {es-sql} driver, it can use {es-sql}.

* <<sql-client-apps-dbeaver, DBeaver>>
* <<sql-client-apps-dbvis, DbVisualizer>>
* <<sql-client-apps-squirrel, SQuirreL SQL>>
* <<sql-client-apps-workbench, SQL Workbench>>

NOTE: Each application has its own requirements and license; these are outside the scope of this documentation
which covers only the configuration aspect with {es-sql}.
