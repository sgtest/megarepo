http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net/[SQuirreL SQL] is a graphical, [multi-platform] Java program that will allow you to view the structure of a JDBC compliant database [...].

IMPORTANT: Elastic does not endorse, promote or provide support for this application; for native Elasticsearch integration in this product, please reach out to its vendor.

==== Prerequisites

* {es-sql} <<sql-jdbc, JDBC driver>>

==== Add {es} JDBC Driver

To add the {es} JDBC driver, use *Windows* > *View Drivers* menu (or Ctrl+Shift+D shortcut):

This opens up the `Drivers` panel on the left. Click on the `+` sign to create a new driver:

Select the *Extra Class Path* tab and *Add* the JDBC jar. *List Drivers* to have the `Class Name` filled-in
automatically and name the connection:

The driver should now appear in the list:

==== Add an alias for {es}

Add a new connection or in SQuirelL terminology an _alias_ using the new driver. To do so, select the *Aliases* panel on the left and click the `+` sign:

Name the new alias and select the `Elasticsearch` driver previously added:

The setup is completed. Double check it by clicking on *Test Connection*.

==== Execute SQL queries

The connection should open automatically (if it has been created before simply click on *Connect* in the *Alias* panel). SQuirelL SQL can now issue SQL commands to {es}:
