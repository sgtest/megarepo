=== Breaking changes

Core::
* Tribe node has been removed in favor of Cross-Cluster-Search

Cross-Cluster-Search::
* `http_addresses` has been removed from the <<cluster-remote-info>> API
  because it is expensive to fetch and no longer needed by Kibana.

Rest API::
* The Clear Cache API only supports `POST` as HTTP method

Aggregations::
* The Percentiles and PercentileRanks aggregations now return `null` in the REST response,
  instead of `NaN`.  This makes it consistent with the rest of the aggregations.  Note:
  this only applies to the REST response, the java objects continue to return `NaN` (also
  consistent with other aggregations)

Suggesters::
* Plugins that register suggesters can now define their own types of suggestions and must
  explicitly indicate the type of suggestion that they produce. Existing plugins will
  require changes to their plugin registration. See the `custom-suggester` example
