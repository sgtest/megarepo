=== Breaking changes

Core::
* Tribe node has been removed in favor of Cross-Cluster-Search

Cross-Cluster-Search::
* `http_addresses` has been removed from the <<cluster-remote-info>> API
  because it is expensive to fetch and no longer needed by Kibana.

Rest API::
* The Clear Cache API only supports `POST` as HTTP method
