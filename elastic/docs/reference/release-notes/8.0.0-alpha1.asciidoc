=== Breaking changes

Aggregations::
* Disallow specifying the same percentile multiple times in percentiles aggregation {es-pull}52257[#52257]

Mapping::
* Dynamic mappings in indices created on 8.0 and later have stricter validation at mapping update time.
  (e.g. incorrect analyzer settings or unknown field types). {es-pull}51233[#51233]

Update by query::
* Unsupported fields provided as part of the script section of the update by query API are now rejected.

Deprecations::
* Remove undocumented endpoints of hot threads API {es-pull}55109[#55109]

Slow loggers::
* `index.indexing.slowlog.level` and `index.search.slowlog.level` are removed. These settings can be worked around
by using appropriate thresholds. If for instance we want to simulate `index.indexing.slowlog.level` = `INFO` then
all we need to do is to set `index.indexing.slowlog.threshold.index.debug` and
`index.indexing.slowlog.threshold.index.trace` to `-1` {es-pull}57591[#57591]

Search::
* Consistent treatment of numeric values for range query on date fields without `format` {es-pull}[#63692]
