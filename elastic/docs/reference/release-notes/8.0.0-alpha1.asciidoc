[discrete]
=== Breaking changes

Aggregations::
* Disallow specifying the same percentile multiple times in percentiles aggregation {es-pull}52257[#52257]

Mapping::
* Dynamic mappings in indices created on 8.0 and later have stricter validation at mapping update time.
  (e.g. incorrect analyzer settings or unknown field types). {es-pull}51233[#51233]

Update by query::
* Unsupported fields provided as part of the script section of the update by query API are now rejected.

Deprecations::
* Remove undocumented endpoints of hot threads API {es-pull}55109[#55109]

Slow loggers::
* `index.indexing.slowlog.level` and `index.search.slowlog.level` are removed. These settings can be worked around
by using appropriate thresholds. If for instance we want to simulate `index.indexing.slowlog.level` = `INFO` then
all we need to do is to set `index.indexing.slowlog.threshold.index.debug` and
`index.indexing.slowlog.threshold.index.trace` to `-1` {es-pull}57591[#57591]

Search::
* Consistent treatment of numeric values for range query on date fields without `format` {es-pull}[#63692]

[[enhancement-8.0.0-alpha1]]

=== Enhancements

Machine learning::
* The Windows build platform for the {ml} C++ code now uses Visual Studio 2019 {ml-pull}1352[#1352]
* The macOS build platform for the {ml} C++ code is now Mojave running Xcode 11.3.1,
  or Ubuntu 20.04 running clang 8 for cross compilation {ml-pull}1429[#1429]
* The Linux build platform for the {ml} C++ code is now CentOS 7 running gcc 9.3 {ml-pull}1170[#1170]
* Add a new application for evaluating PyTorch models. The app depends on LibTorch - the C++ front end to PyTorch and performs inference on models stored in the TorchScript format {ml-pull}1902[#1902]
