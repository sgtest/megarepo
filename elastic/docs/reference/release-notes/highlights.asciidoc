[[add_new_similarity_field_to_knn_clause_in_search]]
=== Add new `similarity` field to `knn` clause in `_search`
This adds a new parameter to `knn` that allows filtering nearest
neighbor results that are outside a given similarity.

`num_candidates` and `k` are still required as this controls the
nearest-neighbor vector search accuracy and exploration. For each shard
the query will search `num_candidates` and only keep those that are
within the provided `similarity` boundary, and then finally reduce to
only the global top `k` as normal.

For example, when using the `l2_norm` indexed similarity value, this
could be considered a `radius` post-filter on `knn`.
