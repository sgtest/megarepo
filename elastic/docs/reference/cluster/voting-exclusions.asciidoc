Adds or removes master-eligible nodes from the
<<modules-discovery-voting,voting configuration exclusion list>>.

[float]
=== Request

`POST _cluster/voting_config_exclusions/<node_name>` +

`DELETE _cluster/voting_config_exclusions`

[float]
=== Path parameters

`node_name`::
  A <<cluster-nodes,node filter>> that identifies {es} nodes.

[float]
=== Description
  
By default, if there are more than three master-eligible nodes in the cluster
and you remove fewer than half of the master-eligible nodes in the cluster at
once, the <<modules-discovery-voting,voting configuration>> automatically
shrinks.

If you want to shrink the voting configuration to contain fewer than three nodes
or to remove half or more of the master-eligible nodes in the cluster at once,
you must use this API to remove departed nodes from the voting configuration
manually. It adds an entry for that node in the voting configuration exclusions
list. The cluster then tries to reconfigure the voting configuration to remove
that node and to prevent it from returning.

If the API fails, you can safely retry it.  Only a successful response
guarantees that the node has been removed from the voting configuration and will
not be reinstated.

NOTE: Voting exclusions are required only when you remove at least half of the
master-eligible nodes from a cluster in a short time period. They are not
required when removing master-ineligible nodes or fewer than half of the
master-eligible nodes.

The <<modules-discovery-settings,`cluster.max_voting_config_exclusions`
setting>> limits the size of the voting configuration exclusion list. The
default value is `10`. Since voting configuration exclusions are persistent and
limited in number, you must clear the voting config exclusions list once the
exclusions are no longer required.

There is also a
<<modules-discovery-settings,`cluster.auto_shrink_voting_configuration` setting>>,
which is set to true by default. If it is set to false, you must use this API to
maintain the voting configuration.
