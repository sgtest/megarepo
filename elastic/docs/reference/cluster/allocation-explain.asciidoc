== Cluster Allocation Explain API

The purpose of the cluster allocation explain API is to provide
explanations for shard allocations in the cluster.  For unassigned shards,
the explain API provides an explanation for why the shard is unassigned.
For assigned shards, the explain API provides an explanation for why the
shard is remaining on its current node and has not moved or rebalanced to
another node.  This API can be very useful when attempting to diagnose why
a shard is unassigned or why a shard continues to remain on its current node
when you might expect otherwise.

=== Explain API Request

To explain the allocation of a shard, first an index should exist:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT /myindex
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TESTSETUP

And then the allocation for shards of that index can be explained:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_cluster/allocation/explain
{
  "index": "myindex",
  "shard": 0,
  "primary": true
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

Specify the `index` and `shard` id of the shard you would like an explanation
for, as well as the `primary` flag to indicate whether to explain the primary
shard for the given shard id or one of its replica shards.  These three request
parameters are required.

You may also specify an optional `current_node` request parameter to only explain
a shard that is currently located on `current_node`.  The `current_node` can be
specified as either the node id or node name.

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_cluster/allocation/explain
{
  "index": "myindex",
  "shard": 0,
  "primary": false,
  "current_node": "nodeA"                         <1>
}
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[skip:no way of knowing the current_node]
<1> The node where shard 0 currently has a replica on

You can also have Elasticsearch explain the allocation of the first unassigned
shard that it finds by sending an empty body for the request:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_cluster/allocation/explain
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

=== Explain API Response

This section includes examples of the cluster allocation explain API response output
under various scenarios.

The API response for an unassigned shard:

          "decision" : "NO",
          "explanation" : "node does not match index setting [index.routing.allocation.include] filters [_name:\"non_existent_node\"]"  <6>
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
--------------------------------------------------
// TESTRESPONSE[s/"at" : "[^"]*"/"at" : $body.$_path/]
// TESTRESPONSE[s/"node_id" : "[^"]*"/"node_id" : $body.$_path/]
// TESTRESPONSE[s/"transport_address" : "[^"]*"/"transport_address" : $body.$_path/]

<1> The current state of the shard
<2> The reason for the shard originally becoming unassigned
<3> Whether to allocate the shard
<4> Whether to allocate the shard to the particular node
<5> The decider which led to the `no` decision for the node
<6> An explanation as to why the decider returned a `no` decision, with a helpful hint pointing to the setting that led to the decision

You can return information gathered by the cluster info service about disk usage
and shard sizes by setting the `include_disk_info` parameter to `true`:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_cluster/allocation/explain?include_disk_info=true
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

Additionally, if you would like to include all decisions that were factored into the final
decision, the `include_yes_decisions` parameter will return all decisions for each node:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_cluster/allocation/explain?include_yes_decisions=true
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE

The default value for `include_yes_decisions` is `false`, which will only
include the `no` decisions in the response.  This is generally what you would
want, as the `no` decisions indicate why a shard is unassigned or cannot be moved,
and including all decisions include the `yes` ones adds a lot of verbosity to the
API's response output.
