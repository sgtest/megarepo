[[cluster-nodes-stats-api-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}

You can use the cluster nodes stats API to retrieve statistics for nodes in a cluster.


All the nodes selective options are explained <<cluster-nodes,here>>.

By default, all stats are returned. You can limit the returned information by 
using metrics.

===== Retrieve ingest statistics only

To return only ingest-related node statistics, set the `<metric>` path
parameter to `ingest` and use the
<<common-options-response-filtering,`filter_path`>> query parameter.

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_nodes/stats/ingest?filter_path=nodes.*.ingest
--------------------------------------------------

You can use the `metric` and `filter_path` query parameters to get the same
response.

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_nodes/stats?metric=ingest&filter_path=nodes.*.ingest
--------------------------------------------------

To further refine the response, change the `filter_path` value.
For example, the following request only returns ingest pipeline statistics.

--------------------------------------------------
GET /_nodes/stats?metric=ingest&filter_path=nodes.*.ingest.pipelines
