==== {api-description-title}

The health API returns a the health status of an Elasticsearch cluster. It
returns a list of components that compose Elasticsearch functionality. Each
component's health is determined by health indicators associated with the
component.

Each indicator has a health status of: `green`, `yellow` or `red`. The indicator will
provide an explanation and metadata describing the reason for its current health status.

A component's status is controlled by the worst indicator status. The cluster's status
is controlled by the worst component status.
