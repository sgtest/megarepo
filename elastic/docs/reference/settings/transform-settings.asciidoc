You do not need to configure any settings to use {transforms}. It is enabled by
default.

All of these settings can be added to the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file.
The dynamic settings can also be updated across a cluster with the
<<cluster-update-settings,cluster update settings API>>. Dynamic settings take
precedence over settings in the `elasticsearch.yml` file.

==== General {transforms} settings

`node.roles: [ transform ]`::
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>) Set `node.roles` to contain `transform` to
identify the node as a _transform node_. If you use the default settings for a
node, it does not have the `transform` role.
+
If a node doesn't have this role, the node cannot run transforms. If you want to 
run transforms, there must be at least one transform node in your cluster.
+
If you use the `node.roles` setting, all required roles must be explicitly set.
Consult <<modules-node>> to learn more.

`xpack.transform.enabled`::
deprecated:[7.8.0,Basic License features should always be enabled]
(<<static-cluster-setting,Static>>) This deprecated setting no longer has any
effect.

`xpack.transform.num_transform_failure_retries`::
(<<cluster-update-settings,Dynamic>>) The number of times that a {transform}
retries when it experiences a non-fatal error. Once the number of retries is
exhausted, the {transform} task is marked as `failed`. The default value is `10`
with a valid minimum of `0` and maximum of `100`. If a {transform} is already
running, it has to be restarted to use the changed setting.
