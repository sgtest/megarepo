templates. For more information, see <<ilm-gs-create-policy>>.

`index.lifecycle.name`::
The name of the policy to use to manage the index.

`index.lifecycle.rollover_alias`::
The index alias to update when the index rolls over. Specify when using a
policy that contains a rollover action. When the index rolls over, the alias is
updated to reflect that the index is no longer the write index. For more
information about rollover, see <<using-policies-rollover>>.
