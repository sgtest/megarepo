[[indices-exists]]
== Indices Exists

Used to check if the index (indices) exists or not. For example:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
HEAD twitter
--------------------------------------------------
// CONSOLE
// TEST[setup:twitter]

The HTTP status code indicates if the index exists or not. A `404` means
it does not exist, and `200` means it does.

IMPORTANT: This request does not distinguish between an index and an alias,
i.e. status code `200` is also returned if an alias exists with that name.
