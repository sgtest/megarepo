=== Create data stream API

<titleabbrev>Create data stream</titleabbrev>
++++

Creates a new data stream.

Data streams provide a convenient way to ingest, search, and manage time series
data. Documents containing time series data may be indexed directly into a data
stream and searched through the data stream. Behind the scenes, data streams
contain one or more hidden backing indices and a generation attribute that
indicates which of the backing indices is the write index, the index into which
documents will be ingested.

Backing indices are generated with the naming convention
`<data-stream-name>-zzzzzz` where `zzzzzz` is the six-digit, zero-padded
generation of the data stream. For example, a data stream named
`web-server-logs` with a generation of 34 would have a write index named
`web-server-logs-000034`. While nothing prevents backing indices from being
addressed directly, data streams are integrated with the
<<indices-rollover-index, rollover index API>> and
<<index-lifecycle-management, index lifecycle management (ILM)>> to facilitate
the management of the time series data contained in their backing indices.

[[indices-create-data-stream-request]]
==== {api-request-title}

`PUT _data_stream/<data-stream>`

[[indices-create-data-stream-desc]]
==== {api-description-title}
You can use the create data stream API to add a new data stream to an {es}
cluster. When creating a data stream, you must specify the following:

* The name of the data stream
* The name of the timestamp field.

[[indices-create-data-stream-api-path-params]]
==== {api-path-parms-title}

`<data-stream>`::
+
--
(Required, string) Name of the data stream to create.

Data stream names must meet the following criteria:

- Lowercase only
- Cannot include `\`, `/`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, `|`, ` ` (space character),
`,`, `#`, `:`
- Cannot start with `-`, `_`, `+`, `.`
- Cannot be `.` or `..`
- Cannot be longer than 255 bytes (note it is bytes, so multi-byte characters
will count towards the 255 limit faster)
--

[[indices-create-data-stream-api-request-body]]
==== {api-request-body-title}

`timestamp_field`::
(Required, string) The name of the timestamp field. This field must be present
in all documents indexed into the data stream and must be of type
<<date, `date`>> or <<date_nanos, `date_nanos`>>.
