== {slm-init}: Manage the snapshot lifecycle

You can set up snapshot lifecycle policies to automate the timing, frequency, and retention of snapshots.
Snapshot policies can apply to multiple indices.

The {slm} ({slm-init}) <<snapshot-lifecycle-management-api, CRUD APIs>> provide
the building blocks for the snapshot policy features that are part of {kib} Management.
{kibana-ref}/snapshot-repositories.html[Snapshot and Restore] makes it easy to 
set up policies, register snapshot repositories, view and manage snapshots, and restore indices.

You can stop and restart {slm-init} to temporarily pause automatic backups while performing
upgrades or other maintenance.
