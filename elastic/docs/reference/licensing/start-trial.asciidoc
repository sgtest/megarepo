==== Description

The `start trial` API enables you to start a 30-day trial, which gives access to
all subscription features.

NOTE: You are allowed to initiate a trial only if your cluster has not already
activated a trial for the current major product version. For example, if you
have already activated a trial for v6.0, you cannot start a new trial until v7.0.
You can, however, request an extended trial at {extendtrial}.

To check the status of your trial, use <<get-trial-status>>. 

For more information about features and subscriptions, see
https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions.

==== Authorization

You must have `manage` cluster privileges to use this API.
For more information, see
<<security-privileges>>.
