=== Breaking API changes in 7.0

==== Camel case and underscore parameters deprecated in 6.x have been removed
A number of duplicate parameters deprecated in 6.x have been removed from
Bulk request, Multi Get request, Term Vectors request, and More Like This Query
requests.

The following camel case parameters have been removed:

* `opType`
* `versionType`, `_versionType`

The following parameters starting with underscore have been removed:

* `_parent`
* `_retry_on_conflict`
* `_routing`
* `_version`
* `_version_type`

Instead of these removed parameters, use their non camel case equivalents without
starting underscore, e.g. use `version_type` instead of `_version_type` or `versionType`.

==== The parameter `fields` deprecated in 6.x has been removed from Bulk request 
and Update request. The Update API returns `400 - Bad request` if request contains 
unknown parameters (instead of ignored in the previous version).

[[remove-suggest-metric]]
==== Remove support for `suggest` metric/index metric in indices stats and nodes stats APIs

Previously, `suggest` stats were folded into `search` stats. Support for the
`suggest` metric on the indices stats and nodes stats APIs remained for
backwards compatibility. Backwards support for the `suggest` metric was
deprecated in 6.3.0 and now removed in 7.0.0.
