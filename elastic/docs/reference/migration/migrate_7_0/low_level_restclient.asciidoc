=== Low-level REST client changes

==== Deprecated flavors of performRequest have been removed

We deprecated the flavors of `performRequest` and `performRequestAsync` that
do not take `Request` objects in 6.4.0 in favor of the flavors that take
`Request` objects because those methods can be extended without breaking
backwards compatibility.

==== Removed setHosts

We deprecated `setHosts` in 6.4.0 in favor of `setNodes` because it supports
host metadata used by the `NodeSelector`.
