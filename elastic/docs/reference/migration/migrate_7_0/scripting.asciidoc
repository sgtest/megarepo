=== Scripting changes

==== getDate() and getDates() removed

Fields of type `long` and `date` had `getDate()` and `getDates()` methods
(for multi valued fields) to get an object with date specific helper methods
for the current doc value. In 5.3.0, `date` fields were changed to expose
this same date object directly when calling `doc["myfield"].value`, and
the getter methods for date objects were deprecated. These methods have
now been removed. Instead, use `.value` on `date` fields, or explicitly
parse `long` fields into a date object using
`Instance.ofEpochMillis(doc["myfield"].value)`.
