=== Aggregations changes

[float]
==== Deprecated `global_ordinals_hash` and `global_ordinals_low_cardinality` execution hints for terms aggregations have been removed

These `execution_hint` are removed and should be replaced by `global_ordinals`.

[float]
==== `search.max_buckets` in the cluster setting

The dynamic cluster setting named `search.max_buckets` now defaults
to 10,000 (instead of unlimited in the previous version).
Requests that try to return more than the limit will fail with an exception.

[float]
==== `missing` option of the `composite` aggregation has been removed

The `missing` option of the `composite` aggregation, deprecated in 6.x,
has been removed. `missing_bucket` should be used instead.

[float]
==== Replaced `params._agg` with `state` context variable in scripted metric aggregations

The object used to share aggregation state between the scripts in a Scripted Metric
Aggregation is now a variable called `state` available in the script context, rather than
being provided via the `params` object as `params._agg`.

[float]
==== Make metric aggregation script parameters `reduce_script` and `combine_script` mandatory

The metric aggregation has been changed to require these two script parameters to ensure users are
explicitly defining how their data is processed.
