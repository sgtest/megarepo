=== Aggregations changes

==== Deprecated `global_ordinals_hash` and `global_ordinals_low_cardinality` execution hints for terms aggregations have been removed

These `execution_hint` are removed and should be replaced by `global_ordinals`.

==== `search.max_buckets` in the cluster setting

The dynamic cluster setting named `search.max_buckets` now defaults
to 10,000 (instead of unlimited in the previous version).
Requests that try to return more than the limit will fail with an exception.
