=== High-level REST client changes

==== API methods accepting `Header` argument have been removed

All API methods accepting headers as a `Header` varargs argument, deprecated
since 6.4, have been removed in favour of the newly introduced methods that
accept instead a `RequestOptions` argument. In case you are not specifying any
header, e.g. `client.index(indexRequest)` becomes
`client.index(indexRequest, RequestOptions.DEFAULT)`.
In case you are specifying headers
e.g. `client.index(indexRequest, new Header("name" "value"))` becomes
`client.index(indexRequest, RequestOptions.DEFAULT.toBuilder().addHeader("name", "value").build());`

==== Cluster Health API default to `cluster` level

The Cluster Health API used to default to `shards` level to ease migration
from transport client that doesn't support the `level` parameter and always
returns information including indices and shards details. The level default
value has been aligned with the Elasticsearch default level: `cluster`.
