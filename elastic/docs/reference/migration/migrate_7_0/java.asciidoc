=== Java API changes

==== `isShardsAcked` deprecated in `6.2` has been removed

`isShardsAcked` has been replaced by `isShardsAcknowledged` in
`CreateIndexResponse`, `RolloverResponse` and
`CreateIndexClusterStateUpdateResponse`.

==== `prepareExecute` removed from the client api

The `prepareExecute` method which created a request builder has been
removed from the client api. Instead, construct a builder for the
appropriate request directly.
