=== Plugins changes

==== Azure Repository plugin

* The legacy azure settings which where starting with `cloud.azure.storage.` prefix have been removed.
This includes `account`, `key`, `default` and `timeout`.
You need to use settings which are starting with `azure.client.` prefix instead.

* Global timeout setting `cloud.azure.storage.timeout` has been removed.
You must set it per azure client instead. Like `azure.client.default.timeout: 10s` for example.

See {plugins}/repository-azure-usage.html#repository-azure-repository-settings[Azure Repository settings].

==== Google Cloud Storage Repository plugin

* The repository settings `application_name`, `connect_timeout` and `read_timeout` have been removed and
must now be specified in the client settings instead.

See {plugins}/repository-gcs-client.html#repository-gcs-client[Google Cloud Storage Client Settings].
