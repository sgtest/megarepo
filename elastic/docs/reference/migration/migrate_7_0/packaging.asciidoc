[[systemd-service-file-config]]
==== systemd service file is no longer configuration

The systemd service file `/usr/lib/systemd/system/elasticsearch.service`
was previously marked as a configuration file in rpm and deb packages.
Overrides to the systemd elasticsearch service should be made
in `/etc/systemd/system/elasticsearch.service.d/override.conf`.
