==== systemd service file is no longer configuration

The systemd service file `/usr/lib/systemd/system/elasticsearch.service`
was previously marked as a configuration file in rpm and deb packages.
Overrides to the systemd elasticsearch service should be made
in `/etc/systemd/system/elasticsearch.service.d/override.conf`.

[float]
==== tar package no longer includes windows specific files

The tar package previously included files in the `bin` directory meant only
for windows. These files have been removed. Use the `zip` package instead.
