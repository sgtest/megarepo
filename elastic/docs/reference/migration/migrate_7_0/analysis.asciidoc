=== Analysis changes

[float]
==== Limiting the number of tokens produced by _analyze

To safeguard against out of memory errors, the number of tokens that can be produced
using the `_analyze` endpoint has been limited to 10000. This default limit can be changed
for a particular index with the index setting `index.analyze.max_token_count`.

[float]
==== Limiting the length of an analyzed text during highlighting

Highlighting a text that was indexed without offsets or term vectors,
requires analysis of this text in memory real time during the search request.
For large texts this analysis may take substantial amount of time and memory.
To protect against this, the maximum number of characters that will be analyzed has been
limited to 1000000. This default limit can be changed
for a particular index with the index setting `index.highlight.max_analyzed_offset`.

[float]
==== `delimited_payload_filter` renaming

The `delimited_payload_filter` was deprecated and renamed to `delimited_payload` in 6.2.
Using it in indices created before 7.0 will issue deprecation warnings. Using the old
name in new indices created in 7.0 will throw an error. Use the new name `delimited_payload`
instead.

[float]
==== `standard` filter has been removed

The `standard` token filter has been removed because it doesn't change anything in the stream.

[float]
==== Deprecated standard_html_strip analyzer

The `standard_html_strip` analyzer has been deprecated, and should be replaced
with a combination of the `standard` tokenizer and `html_strip` char_filter.
Indexes created using this analyzer will still be readable in elasticsearch 7.0,
but it will not be possible to create new indexes using it.
