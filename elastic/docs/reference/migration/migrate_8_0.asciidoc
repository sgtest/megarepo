.Indices created in {es} 6.x and earlier versions are not supported.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Elasticsearch 8.0 can read indices created in version 7.0 or above.  An
Elasticsearch 8.0 node will not start in the presence of indices created in a
version of Elasticsearch before 7.0.

*Impact* +
Reindex indices created in {es} 6.x or before with {es} 7.x if they need to be carried forward to  {es} 8.x. 
====

.REST API endpoints containing `_xpack` have been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In 7.0, we deprecated REST endpoints that contain `_xpack` in their path. These
endpoints are now removed in 8.0. Each endpoint that was deprecated and removed
is replaced with a new endpoint that does not contain `_xpack`. As an example,
`/{index}/_xpack/graph/_explore` is replaced by `/{index}/_graph/explore`.

*Impact* +
Use the replacement REST API endpoints. Requests submitted to the `_xpack`
API endpoints will return an error.
