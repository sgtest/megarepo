.The `listener` thread pool has been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Previously, the transport client used the thread pool to ensure listeners aren't
called back on network threads. The transport client has been removed
in 8.0, and the thread pool is no longer needed.

*Impact* +
Remove `listener` thread pool settings from `elasticsearch.yml` for any nodes.
Specifying `listener` thread pool settings in `elasticsearch.yml` will result in
an error on startup.
====

.The `fixed_auto_queue_size` thread pool type has been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `fixed_auto_queue_size` thread pool type, previously marked as an
experimental feature, was deprecated in 7.x and has been removed in 8.0.
The `search` and `search_throttled` thread pools have the `fixed` type now.

*Impact* +
No action needed.
