[[ngram-edgengram-filter-names-removed]]
.The `nGram` and `edgeNGram` token filter names have been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `nGram` and `edgeNGram` token filter names that have been deprecated since
version 6.4 have been removed. Both token filters can only be used by their
alternative names `ngram` and `edge_ngram` since version 7.0.

*Impact* +
Use the equivalent `ngram` and `edge_ngram` token filters. Requests containing
the `nGram` and `edgeNGram` token filter names will return an error.

[[nGram-edgeNGram-tokenizer-dreprecation]]
.The `nGram` and `edgeNGram` tokenizer names have been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `nGram` and `edgeNGram` tokenizer names haven been deprecated with 7.6 and are no longer
supported on new indices. Mappings for indices created after 7.6 will continue to work but
emit a deprecation warning. The tokenizer name should be changed to the fully equivalent
`ngram` or `edge_ngram` names for new indices and in index templates.

*Impact* +
Use the `ngram` and `edge_ngram` tokenizers. Requests to create new indices
using the `nGram` and `edgeNGram` tokenizer names will return an error.
