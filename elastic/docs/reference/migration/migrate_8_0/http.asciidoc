==== Removal of old HTTP settings

The `http.tcp_no_delay` setting was deprecated in 7.x and has been removed in 8.0. It has been replaced by
`http.tcp.no_delay`.

==== Changes to Encoding Plus Signs in URLs

Starting in version 7.4, a `+` in a URL will be encoded as `%2B` by all REST API functionality. Prior versions handled a `+` as a single space.
If your application requires handling `+` as a single space you can return to the old behaviour by setting the system property
`es.rest.url_plus_as_space` to `true`. Note that this behaviour is deprecated and setting this system property to `true` will cease
to be supported in version 8.
