.The `http.content_type.required` setting has been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `http.content_type.required` setting was deprecated in Elasticsearch 6.0
and has been removed in Elasticsearch 8.0. The setting was introduced in
Elasticsearch 5.3 to prepare users for Elasticsearch 6.0, where content type
auto detection was removed for HTTP requests.

*Impact* +
Discontinue use of the `http.content_type.required` system property.
Specifying this property in `elasticsearch.yml` will result in an error on
startup.
====

.The `http.tcp_no_delay` setting has been replaced by `http.tcp.no_delay`.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `http.tcp_no_delay` setting was deprecated in 7.x and has been removed in 8.0. It has been replaced by
`http.tcp.no_delay`.

*Impact* +
Use the `http.tcp.no_delay` setting. Discontinue use of the `http.tcp_no_delay`
setting. Specifying the `http.tcp_no_delay` setting in `elasticsearch.yml` will
result in an error on startup.
====

.The `es.rest.url_plus_as_space` system property has been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Starting in version 7.4, a `+` in a URL will be encoded as `%2B` by all REST API functionality. Prior versions handled a `+` as a single space.
In these previous versions, if your application required handling `+` as a single space, you could return to the old behaviour by setting the system property
`es.rest.url_plus_as_space` to `true`. Note that this behaviour is deprecated and setting this system property to `true` will cease
to be supported in version 8.

*Impact* +
Update your workflow and applications to assume `+` in a URL is encoded as
`%2B`. Discontinue use of the `es.rest.url_plus_as_space` system property.
Specifying this property in `elasticsearch.yml` will result in an error on
startup.
