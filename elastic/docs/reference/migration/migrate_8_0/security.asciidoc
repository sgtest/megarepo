xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true <1>
xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path: elastic-certificates.p12
xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.path: elastic-certificates.p12

xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true <1>
xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate: elasticsearch.crt 
xpack.security.http.ssl.key: elasticsearch.key
