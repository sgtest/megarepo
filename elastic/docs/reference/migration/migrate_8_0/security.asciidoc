The `xpack.security.authc.realms.{type}.{name}.order` setting is now required and must be
specified for each explicitly configured realm. Each value must be unique.
The cluster will fail to start if the requirements are not met.

For example, the following configuration is invalid:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.authc.realms.kerberos.kerb1:
  keytab.path: es.keytab
  remove_realm_name: false
--------------------------------------------------

And must be configured as:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
xpack.security.authc.realms.kerberos.kerb1:
  order: 0
  keytab.path: es.keytab
  remove_realm_name: false

[[builtin-users-changes]]
==== Changes to built-in users

.The `kibana` user has been renamed `kibana_system`.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `kibana` user was historically used to authenticate {kib} to {es}.
The name of this user was confusing, and was often mistakenly used to login to {kib}.
This has been renamed to `kibana_system` in order to reduce confusion, and to better
align with other built-in system accounts.

If your `kibana.yml` used to contain:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
elasticsearch.username: kibana
--------------------------------------------------

then you should update to use the new `kibana_system` user instead:
[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
elasticsearch.username: kibana_system
--------------------------------------------------
====

[discrete]
[[builtin-roles-changes]]
==== Changes to built-in roles

.The `kibana_user` role has been renamed `kibana_admin`.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Users who were previously assigned the `kibana_user` role should instead be assigned
the `kibana_admin` role. This role grants the same set of privileges as `kibana_user`, but has been
renamed to better reflect its intended use.
