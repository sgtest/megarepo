.The `user_agent` ingest processor's `ecs` parameter has no effect.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In 7.2, we deprecated the `ecs` parameter for the `user_agent` ingest processor.
In 8.x, the `user_agent` ingest processor will only return {ecs-ref}[Elastic
Common Schema (ECS)] fields, regardless of the `ecs` value.

*Impact* +
To avoid deprecation warnings, remove the parameter from your ingest pipelines.
If a pipeline specifies an `ecs` value, the value is ignored.

.The default Maxmind geoip databases have been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The default Maxmind geoip databases that shipped by default with Elasticsearch
have been removed. These databases are out dated and stale and using these
databases will likely result in incorrect geoip lookups.

By default since 7.13, these pre-packaged geoip databases
were used in case no database were specified in the config directory or before
the geoip downloader downloaded the geoip databases. When the geoip database
downloader completed downloading the new databases then these pre-packaged
databases were no longer used.

*Impact* +
If the geoip downloader is disabled and no geoip databases are provided
in the config directory of each ingest node then the geoip processor will
no longer perform geoip lookups and tag these documents with the fact that
the requested database is no longer available.

After a cluster has been started and before the geoip downloader has completed
downloading the most up to data databases, the geoip processor will not perform
any geoip lookups and tag documents that the requested database is not available.
After the geoip downloader has completed downloading the most up to data databases
then the geoip processor will function as normal. The window of time that the
geoip processor can't do geoip lookups after cluster startup should be very small.
