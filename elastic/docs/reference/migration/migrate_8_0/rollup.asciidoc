==== StartRollupJob endpoint returns success if job already started

Previously, attempting to start an already-started rollup job would
result in a `500 InternalServerError: Cannot start task for Rollup Job
[job] because state was [STARTED]` exception.

Now, attempting to start a job that is already started will just
return a successful `200 OK: started` response.
