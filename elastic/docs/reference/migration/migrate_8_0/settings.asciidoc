[float]
[[search-remote-settings-removed]]
==== The `search.remote` settings have been removed

In 6.5 these settings were deprecated in favor of `cluster.remote`. In 7.x we
provided automatic upgrading of these settings to their `cluster.remote`
counterparts. In 8.0.0, these settings have been removed. Elasticsearch will
refuse to start if you have these settings in your configuration or cluster
state.

[float]
[[remove-pidfile]]
==== `pidfile` setting is replaced by `node.pidfile`

To ensure that all settings are in a proper namespace, the `pidfile` setting was
previously deprecated in version 7.4.0 of Elasticsearch, and is removed in
version 8.0.0. Instead, use `node.pidfile`.

[float]
[[remove-processors]]
==== `processors` setting is replaced by `node.processors`

To ensure that all settings are in a proper namespace, the `processors` setting
was previously deprecated in version 7.4.0 of Elasticsearch, and is removed in
version 8.0.0. Instead, use `node.processors`.

[float]
==== `node.processors` can no longer exceed the available number of processors

Previously it was possible to set the number of processors used to set the
default sizes for the thread pools to be more than the number of available
processors. As this leads to more context switches and more threads but without
an increase in the number of physical CPUs on which to schedule these additional
threads, the `node.processors` setting is now bounded by the number of available
processors.

[float]
==== `cluster.remote.connect` is removed

In Elasticsearch 7.7.0, the setting `cluster.remote.connect` was deprecated in
favor of setting `node.remote_cluster_client`. In Elasticsearch 8.0.0, the
setting `cluster.remote.connect` is removed.

[float]
==== `node.local_storage` is removed

In Elasticsearch 7.8.0, the setting `node.local_storage` was deprecated and
beginning in Elasticsearch 8.0.0 all nodes will require local storage. Therefore,
the `node.local_storage` setting has been removed.

[float]
==== `auth.password` for HTTP monitoring is removed

In Elasticsearch 7.7.0, the setting `xpack.monitoring.exporters.<exporterName>.auth.password`
was deprecated in favor of setting `xpack.monitoring.exporters.<exporterName>.auth.secure_password`.
In Elasticsearch 8.0.0, the setting `xpack.monitoring.exporters.<exporterName>.auth.password` is
removed.

[float]
==== Option to disable basic license features is deprecated

In Elasticsearch 7.8.0, the following settings no longer have any effect, and
have been deprecated:

* `xpack.ilm.enabled`
* `xpack.monitoring.enabled`

Previously, these settings could be set to `false` in order to disable the
feature's APIs in a cluster. As of 7.8.0, these basic license features are
always enabled for the {default-dist}.

If you have disabled ILM so that you can use another tool to manage Watcher
indices, the newly introduced `xpack.watcher.use_ilm_index_management` setting
may be set to false.

Additionally, the following settings have been deprecated without removing
their effects:

* `xpack.enrich.enabled`
* `xpack.flattened.enabled`
* `xpack.rollup.enabled`
* `xpack.slm.enabled`
* `xpack.sql.enabled`
* `xpack.transform.enabled`
* `xpack.vectors.enabled`

In future releases, it will not be possible to disable the APIs for Enrichment,
Flattened mappings, Rollup, SLM, SQL, Transforms, and Vectors.

[float]
==== The `prefer_v2_templates` parameter now defaults to `true`

In Elasticsearch 7.8.0 the `?prefer_v2_templates=true|false` parameter was introduced to allow
specifying whether to favor V1 or V2 templates when a new index is created. In 8.0 this now defaults
to `true`, meaning that V2 index templates will always take precedence if they match. V1 templates
will continue to be applied if no V2 index template matches the newly created index pattern.

The `?prefer_v2_templates` parameter is supported on the <<indices-create-index,Create Index>>,
<<docs-index_,Index>>, <<docs-bulk,Bulk>>, <<docs-update,Update>>, and
<<indices-rollover-index,Rollover>> APIs.
