[[search-remote-settings-removed]]
.The `search.remote.*` settings have been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In 6.5 these settings were deprecated in favor of `cluster.remote`. In 7.x we
provided automatic upgrading of these settings to their `cluster.remote`
counterparts. In 8.0.0, these settings have been removed. Elasticsearch will
refuse to start if you have these settings in your configuration or cluster
state.

*Impact* +
Use the replacement `cluster.remote` settings. Discontinue use of the
`search.remote.*` settings. Specifying these settings in `elasticsearch.yml`
will result in an error on startup.
====

[[remove-pidfile]]
.The `pidfile` setting has been replaced by `node.pidfile`.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
To ensure that all settings are in a proper namespace, the `pidfile` setting was
previously deprecated in version 7.4.0 of Elasticsearch, and is removed in
version 8.0.0. Instead, use `node.pidfile`.

*Impact* +
Use the `node.pidfile` setting. Discontinue use of the `pidfile` setting.
Specifying the `pidfile` setting in `elasticsearch.yml` will result in an error
on startup.
====

[[remove-processors]]
.The `processors` setting has been replaced by `node.processors`.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
To ensure that all settings are in a proper namespace, the `processors` setting
was previously deprecated in version 7.4.0 of Elasticsearch, and is removed in
version 8.0.0. Instead, use `node.processors`.

*Impact* +
Use the `node.processors` setting. Discontinue use of the `processors` setting.
Specifying the `processors` setting in `elasticsearch.yml` will result in an
error on startup.
====

.The `node.processors` setting can no longer exceed the available number of processors.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Previously it was possible to set the number of processors used to set the
default sizes for the thread pools to be more than the number of available
processors. As this leads to more context switches and more threads but without
an increase in the number of physical CPUs on which to schedule these additional
threads, the `node.processors` setting is now bounded by the number of available
processors.

*Impact* +
If specified, ensure the value of `node.processors` setting does not exceed the
number of available processors. Setting the `node.processors` value greater than
the number of available processors in `elasticsearch.yml` will result in an
error on startup.
====

.The `cluster.remote.connect` setting has been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In Elasticsearch 7.7.0, the setting `cluster.remote.connect` was deprecated in
favor of setting `node.remote_cluster_client`. In Elasticsearch 8.0.0, the
setting `cluster.remote.connect` is removed.

*Impact* +
Use the `node.remote_cluster_client` setting. Discontinue use of the
`cluster.remote.connect` setting. Specifying the `cluster.remote.connect`
setting in `elasticsearch.yml` will result in an error on startup.
====

.The `node.local_storage` setting has been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In Elasticsearch 7.8.0, the setting `node.local_storage` was deprecated and
beginning in Elasticsearch 8.0.0 all nodes will require local storage. Therefore,
the `node.local_storage` setting has been removed.

*Impact* +
Discontinue use of the `node.local_storage` setting. Specifying this setting in
`elasticsearch.yml` will result in an error on startup.
====

.The `auth.password` setting for HTTP monitoring has been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In Elasticsearch 7.7.0, the setting `xpack.monitoring.exporters.<exporterName>.auth.password`
was deprecated in favor of setting `xpack.monitoring.exporters.<exporterName>.auth.secure_password`.
In Elasticsearch 8.0.0, the setting `xpack.monitoring.exporters.<exporterName>.auth.password` is
removed.

*Impact* +
Use the `xpack.monitoring.exporters.<exporterName>.auth.secure_password`
setting. Discontinue use of the
`xpack.monitoring.exporters.<exporterName>.auth.password` setting. Specifying
the `xpack.monitoring.exporters.<exporterName>.auth.password` setting in
`elasticsearch.yml` will result in an error on startup.
====

.Settings used to disable basic license features have been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The following settings were deprecated in {es} 7.8.0 and have been removed
in {es} 8.0.0:

* `xpack.enrich.enabled`
* `xpack.flattened.enabled`
* `xpack.ilm.enabled`
* `xpack.monitoring.enabled`
* `xpack.rollup.enabled`
* `xpack.slm.enabled`
* `xpack.sql.enabled`
* `xpack.transform.enabled`
* `xpack.vectors.enabled`

These basic license features are now always enabled.

If you have disabled ILM so that you can use another tool to manage Watcher
indices, the newly introduced `xpack.watcher.use_ilm_index_management` setting
may be set to false.

*Impact* +
Discontinue use of the removed settings. Specifying these settings in
`elasticsearch.yml` will result in an error on startup.
====

.Settings used to defer cluster recovery pending a certain number of master nodes have been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The following settings were deprecated in {es} 7.8.0 and have been removed in
{es} 8.0.0:

* `gateway.expected_nodes`
* `gateway.expected_master_nodes`
* `gateway.recover_after_nodes`
* `gateway.recover_after_master_nodes`

It is safe to recover the cluster as soon as a majority of master-eligible
nodes have joined so there is no benefit in waiting for any additional
master-eligible nodes to start.

*Impact* +
Discontinue use of the removed settings. If needed, use
`gateway.expected_data_nodes` or `gateway.recover_after_data_nodes` to defer
cluster recovery pending a certain number of data nodes.
====

.Setting the searchable snapshots shared cache size on non-frozen nodes is no
longer permitted.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Setting `xpack.searchable.snapshot.shared_cache.size` to be positive on a node
that does not have the `data_frozen` role was deprecated in {es} 7.12.0 and has
been removed in {es} 8.0.0.

*Impact* +
Discontinue use of the removed setting. Note that searchable snapshots mounted
using the `shared_cache` storage option were only allocated to nodes that had
the `data_frozen` role, so removing this setting on nodes that do not have the
`data_frozen` role will have no impact on functionality.
====

.By default, destructive index actions do not allow wildcards.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The default value of the setting `action.destructive_requires_name` changes from `false`
to `true` in {es} 8.0.0.

In previous versions, the default setting allowed users to use wildcard
patterns to delete, close, or change index blocks on indices. In order
to prevent the accidental deletion of indices that happen to match a
wildcard pattern, we now require, by default, that any such destructive
operation explicitly name the indices it intends to modify.

*Impact* +
If you would like to use wildcard patterns for destructive actions, set
`action.destructive_requires_name` to `false` using the <<cluster-update-settings,
cluster settings>> API.
====

.Legacy role settings are removed
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The legacy role settings:

* `node.data`
* `node.ingest`
* `node.master`
* `node.ml`
* `node.remote_cluster_client`
* `node.transform`
* `node.voting_only`

have been removed. Instead, use the `node.roles` setting. If you were previously
using the legacy role settings on a 7.13 or later cluster, you will have a
deprecation log message on each of your nodes indicating the exact replacement
value for `node.roles`.

*Impact* +
Discontinue use of the removed settings. Specifying these settings in
`elasticsearch.yml` will result in an error on startup.
