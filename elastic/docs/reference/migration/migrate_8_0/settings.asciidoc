==== The `search.remote` settings have been removed

In 6.5 these settings were deprecated in favor of `cluster.remote`. In 7.x we
provided automatic upgrading of these settings to their `cluster.remote`
counterparts. In 8.0.0, these settings have been removed. Elasticsearch will
refuse to start if you have these settings in your configuration or cluster
state.

==== `processors` can no longer exceed the available number of processors

Previously it was possible to set the number of processors used to set the
default sizes for the thread pools to be more than the number of available
processors. As this leads to more context switches and more threads but without
an increase in the number of physical CPUs on which to schedule these additional
threads, the `processors` setting is now bounded by the number of available
processors.
