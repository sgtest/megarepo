.The `JodaCompatibleDateTime` class has been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
As a transition from Joda datetime to Java datetime, scripting used
an intermediate class called `JodaCompatibleDateTime`. This class has
been removed and is replaced by `ZonedDateTime`. Any use of casting
to a `JodaCompatibleDateTime` in a script will result in a compilation
error, and may not allow the upgraded node to start.

*Impact* +
Before upgrading, replace `getDayOfWeek` with `getDayOfWeekEnum().value` in any
scripts. Any use of `getDayOfWeek` expecting a return value of `int` will result
in a compilation error or runtime error and may not allow the upgraded node to
start.
