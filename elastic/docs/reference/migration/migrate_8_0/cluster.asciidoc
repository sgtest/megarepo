.The voting configuration exclusions API endpoint has changed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `POST /_cluster/voting_config_exclusions/{node_filter}` API has been
removed in favour of `POST /_cluster/voting_config_exclusions?node_names=...`
and `POST /_cluster/voting_config_exclusions?node_ids=...` which allow you to
specify the names or IDs of the nodes to exclude.

*Impact* +
Use `POST /_cluster/voting_config_exclusions?node_ids=...` and specify the nodes
to exclude instead of using a node filter. Requests submitted to the
`/_cluster/voting_config_exclusions/{node_filter}` endpoint will return an
error.
====

.The `cluster.join.timeout` setting has been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `cluster.join.timeout` setting has been removed. Join attempts no longer
time out.

*Impact* +
Do not set `cluster.join.timeout` in your `elasticsearch.yml` file.
====

.HTTP Status code has changed for the Cluster Health API in case of a server timeout.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The {ref}/cluster-health.html[cluster health API] includes options for waiting
for certain health conditions to be satisfied. If the requested conditions are
not satisfied within a timeout then {es} will send back a normal response
including the field `"timed_out": true`. In earlier versions it would also use
the HTTP response code `408 Request timeout` if the request timed out, and `200
OK` otherwise. The `408 Request timeout` response code is not appropriate for
this situation, so from version 8.0.0 {es} will use the response code `200 OK`
for both cases.

*Impact* +
To detect a server timeout, check the `timed_out` field of the JSON response.
