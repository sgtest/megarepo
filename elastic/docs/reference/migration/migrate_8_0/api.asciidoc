==== Deprecated `?local` parameter removed from `GET _cat/nodes` API

The `?local` parameter to the `GET _cat/nodes` API was deprecated in 7.x and is
rejected in 8.0. This parameter caused the API to use the local cluster state
to determine the nodes returned by the API rather than the cluster state from
the master, but this API requests information from each selected node
regardless of the `?local` parameter which means this API does not run in a
fully node-local fashion.

==== Deprecated `local` parameter removed from get field mapping API

The `local` parameter for get field mapping API was deprecated in 7.8 and is
removed in 8.0. This parameter is a no-op and field mappings are always retrieved
locally.
