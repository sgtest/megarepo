[[index-max-adjacency-matrix-filters-removed]]
.The `index.max_adjacency_matrix_filters` index setting has been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `index.max_adjacency_matrix_filters` index setting has been removed.
Previously, you could use this setting to configure the maximum number of
filters for the
{ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-adjacency-matrix-aggregation.html[adjacency
matrix aggregation]. The `indices.query.bool.max_clause_count` index setting now
determines the maximum number of filters for the aggregation.

*Impact* +
Discontinue use of the `index.max_adjacency_matrix_filters` index setting.

Requests that include the index setting will return an error. If you upgrade a
cluster with a 7.x index that already contains the setting, {es} will
{ref}/archived-settings.html#archived-index-settings[archive the setting].

Remove the index setting from index and component templates. Attempts to use a
template that contains the setting will fail and return an error. This includes
automated operations, such the {ilm-init} rollover action.
====

[[remove-term-order-key]]
.The `terms` aggregation no longer supports the `_term` order key.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `terms` aggregation no longer supports the `_term` key in `order` values. To
sort buckets by their term, use `_key` instead.

*Impact* +
Discontinue use of the `_term` order key. Requests that include a `_term` order
key will return an error.
====

[[remove-time-order-key]]
.The `date_histogram` aggregation no longer supports the `_time` order key.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `date_histogram` aggregation no longer supports the `_time` key in `order`
values. To sort buckets by their key, use `_key` instead.

*Impact* +
Discontinue use of the `_time` order key. Requests that include a `_time` order
key will return an error.
====

[[remove-moving-avg-agg]]
.The `moving_avg` aggregation has been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The `moving_avg` aggregation was deprecated in 6.4 and has been removed. To
calculate moving averages, use the
{ref}/search-aggregations-pipeline-movfn-aggregation.html[`moving_fn`
aggregation] instead.

*Impact* +
Discontinue use of the `moving_avg` aggregation. Requests that include the
`moving_avg` aggregation will return an error.
====

[[percentile-duplication]]
.The `percentiles` aggregation's `percents` parameter no longer supports duplicate values.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
If you specify the `percents` parameter with the
{ref}/search-aggregations-metrics-percentile-aggregation.html[`percentiles` aggregation],
its values must be unique. Otherwise, an exception occurs.

*Impact* +
Use unique values in the `percents` parameter of the `percentiles` aggregation.
Requests containing duplicate values in the `percents` parameter will return
an error.
====

[[date-histogram-interval]]
.The `date_histogram` aggregation's `interval` parameter is no longer valid.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
It is now an error to specify the `interval` parameter to the
{ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-datehistogram-aggregation.html[`date_histogram`
aggregation] or the
{ref}/search-aggregations-bucket-composite-aggregation.html#_date_histogram[`composite
date_histogram` source.  Instead, please use either `calendar_interval` or
`fixed_interval` as appropriate.

*Impact* +
Uses of the `interval` parameter in either the `date_histogram` aggregation or
the `date_histogram` composite source will now generate an error.  Instead
please use the more specific `fixed_interval` or `calendar_interval`
parameters.
