.The `repositories.fs.compress` node-level setting has been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
For shared file system repositories (`"type": "fs"`), the node level setting `repositories.fs.compress` could
previously be used to enable compression for all shared file system repositories where `compress` was not specified.
The `repositories.fs.compress` setting has been removed.

*Impact* +
Use the repository specific `compress` setting to enable compression. See
<<modules-snapshots>> for information on the `compress` setting.

Discontinue use of the `repositories.fs.compress` node-level setting.
====

.Metadata files are now compressed by default.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Previously, the default value for `compress` was `false`. The default has been changed to `true`.

This change will affect both newly created repositories and existing repositories where `compress=false` has not been
explicitly specified.

For more information on the compress option, see <<modules-snapshots>>

*Impact* +
Update your workflow and applications to assume a default value of `true` for
the `compress` parameter.
====

.The S3 repository plugin now uses a DNS-style access pattern by default.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
Starting in version 7.4 the `repository-s3` plugin does not use the
now-deprecated path-style access pattern by default. In versions 7.0, 7.1, 7.2
and 7.3 the `repository-s3` plugin always used the path-style access pattern.
This is a breaking change for deployments that only support path-style access
but which are recognized as supporting DNS-style access by the AWS SDK. This
breaking change was made necessary by
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-path-deprecation-plan-the-rest-of-the-story/[AWS's
announcement] that the path-style access pattern is deprecated and will be
unsupported on buckets created after September 30th 2020.

*Impact* +
If your deployment only supports path-style access and is affected by this
change then you must configure the S3 client setting `path_style_access` to
`true`.
====

.Restore requests no longer accept settings.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
In earlier versions, you could pass both `settings` and `index_settings` in the
body of a restore snapshot request, but the `settings` value was ignored. The
restore snapshot API now rejects requests that include a `settings` value.

*Impact* +
Discontinue use of the `settings` parameter in restore
snapshot request. Requests that include these parameters will return an error.
====

.The repository stats API has been removed.
[%collapsible]
====
*Details* +
The repository stats API has been removed. We deprecated this experimental API
in 7.10.0. 

*Impact* +
Use the <<repositories-metering-apis,repositories metering APIs>> instead.
