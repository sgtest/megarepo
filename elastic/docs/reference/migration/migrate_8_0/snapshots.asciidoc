=== Snapshot and Restore changes

[float]
==== Deprecated node level compress setting removed

For shared file system repositories (`"type": "fs"`), the node level setting `repositories.fs.compress` could
previously be used to enable compression for all shared file system repositories where `compress` was not specified.
The `repositories.fs.compress` setting has been removed.

Instead use the repository specific `compress` setting to enable compression. See <<modules-snapshots>> for information
on the `compress` setting.

[float]
==== Compression of meta data files is now on by default

Previously, the default value for `compress` was `false`. The default has been changed to `true`.

This change will affect both newly created repositories and existing repositories where `compress=false` has not been
explicitly specified.

For more information on the compress option, see <<modules-snapshots>>
