==== Deprecated node level compress setting removed

For shared file system repositories (`"type": "fs"`), the node level setting `repositories.fs.compress` could
previously be used to enable compression for all shared file system repositories where `compress` was not specified.
The `repositories.fs.compress` setting has been removed.

Instead use the repository specific `compress` setting to enable compression. See <<modules-snapshots>> for information
on the `compress` setting.
