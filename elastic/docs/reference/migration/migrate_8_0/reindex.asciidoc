=== Reindex changes

Reindex from remote would previously allow URL encoded index-names and not
re-encode them when generating the search request for the remote host. This
leniency has been removed such that all index-names are correctly encoded when
reindex generates remote search requests.

Instead, please specify the index-name without any encoding.

==== Removal of types

The `/{index}/{type}/_delete_by_query` and `/{index}/{type}/_update_by_query` REST endpoints have been removed in favour of `/{index}/_delete_by_query` and `/{index}/_update_by_query`, since indexes no longer contain types, these typed endpoints are obsolete.
