=== Reindex changes

Reindex from remote would previously allow URL encoded index-names and not
re-encode them when generating the search request for the remote host. This
leniency has been removed such that all index-names are correctly encoded when
reindex generates remote search requests.

Instead, please specify the index-name without any encoding.
