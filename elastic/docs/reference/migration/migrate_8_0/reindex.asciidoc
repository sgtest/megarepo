=== Reindex changes

Reindex from remote would previously allow URL encoded index-names and not
re-encode them when generating the search request for the remote host. This
leniency has been removed such that all index-names are correctly encoded when
reindex generates remote search requests.

Instead, please specify the index-name without any encoding.

==== Removal of types

The `/{index}/{type}/_delete_by_query` and `/{index}/{type}/_update_by_query` REST endpoints have been removed in favour of `/{index}/_delete_by_query` and `/{index}/_update_by_query`, since indexes no longer contain types, these typed endpoints are obsolete.

==== Removal of size parameter

Previously, a `_reindex` request had two different size specifications in the body:

- Outer level, determining the maximum number of documents to process
- Inside the `source` element, determining the scroll/batch size.

The outer level `size` parameter has now been renamed to `max_docs` to
avoid confusion and clarify its semantics.

Similarly, the `size` parameter has been renamed to `max_docs` for
`_delete_by_query` and `_update_by_query` to keep the 3 interfaces consistent.
