==== Field capabilities request format

In the past, `fields` could be provided either as a parameter, or as part of the request
body. Specifying `fields` in the request body is now deprecated, and instead they should
always be supplied through a request parameter. In 7.0.0, the field capabilities API will
not accept `fields` supplied in the request body.
