IMPORTANT: Use this API to check for system features that need to be upgraded before
a major version upgrade. You should run it on the last minor version of the
major version you are upgrading from.

The feature upgrade APIs are to be used to retrieve information about system features
that have to be upgraded before a cluster can be migrated to the next major version number,
and to trigger an automated system upgrade that might potentially involve downtime for
{es} system features.

[[feature-upgrade-api-request]]
==== {api-request-title}

`GET /migration/system_features`

[[feature-upgrade-api-prereqs]]
==== {api-prereq-title}

* If the {es} {security-features} are enabled, you must have the `manage`
<<privileges-list-cluster,cluster privilege>> to use this API.

To see the list of system features needing upgrades, submit a GET request to the
`_migration/system_features` endpoint:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /_migration/system_features
--------------------------------------------------

Example response:

[source,console-result]
--------------------------------------------------

// TESTRESPONSE[s/"minimum_index_version" : "8.0.0"/"minimum_index_version" : $body.$_path/]

This response tells us that Elasticsearch security needs its internal
indices upgraded before we can upgrade the cluster to 8.0.

To perform the required upgrade, submit a POST request to the same endpoint.

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
POST /_migration/system_features
--------------------------------------------------

Example response:

[source,console-result]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "accepted" : true,
  "features" : [
    {
      "feature_name" : "security"
    }
  ]
}
--------------------------------------------------
// TESTRESPONSE[skip: can't actually upgrade system indices in these tests]

This tells us that the security index is being upgraded. To check the
overall status of the upgrade, call the endpoint with GET.
