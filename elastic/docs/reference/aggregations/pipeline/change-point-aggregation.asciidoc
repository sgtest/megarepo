experimental::[]

A sibling pipeline that detects, spikes, dips, and change points in a metric. Given a distribution of values
provided by the sibling multi-bucket aggregation, this aggregation indicates the bucket of any spike or dip
and/or the bucket at which the largest change in the distribution of values, if they are statistically significant.



[[change-point-agg-syntax]]
==== Parameters

`buckets_path`::
(Required, string)
Path to the buckets that contain one set of values in which to detect a change point. There must be at least 22 bucketed
values. Fewer than 1,000 is preferred.
For syntax, see <<buckets-path-syntax>>.

==== Syntax

A `change_point` aggregation looks like this in isolation:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  "change_point": {
    "buckets_path": "date_histogram>_count" <1>
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE
<1> The buckets containing the values to test against.

[[change-point-agg-response]]
==== Response body

`bucket`::
(Optional, object)
Values of the bucket that indicates the discovered change point. Not returned if no change point was found.
All the aggregations in the bucket are returned as well.
+
.Properties of bucket
[%collapsible%open]
====
`key`:::
(value)
The key of the bucket matched. Could be string or numeric.

`doc_count`:::
(number)
The document count of the bucket.
====

`type`::
(object)
The found change point type and its related values. Possible types:
+
--
* `dip`: a significant dip occurs at this change point
* `distribution_change`: the overall distribution of the values has changed significantly
* `non_stationary`: there is no change point, but the values are not from a stationary distribution
* `spike`: a significant spike occurs at this point
* `stationary`: no change point found
* `step_change`: the change indicates a statistically significant step up or down in value distribution
* `trend_change`: there is an overall trend change occurring at this point
--

    "changes" : {
      "bucket" : {
        "key" : "2022-01-28T23:00:00.000Z", <1>
        "doc_count" : 48, <2>
        "ticket_price" : { <3>
          "value" : 1187.61083984375
        }
      },
      "type" : { <4>
        "distribution_change" : {
          "p_value" : 0.023753965139433175, <5>
          "change_point" : 40 <6>
        }
      }
    }
--------------------------------------------------
// NOTCONSOLE
<1> The bucket key that is the change point.
<2> The number of documents in that bucket.
<3> Aggregated values in the bucket.
<4> Type of change found.
<5> The `p_value` indicates how extreme the change is; lower values indicate greater change.
<6> The specific bucket where the change occurs (indexing starts at `0`).
