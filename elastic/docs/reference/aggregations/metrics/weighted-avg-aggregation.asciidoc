=== Weighted avg aggregation
++++
<titleabbrev>Weighted avg</titleabbrev>
++++

A `single-value` metrics aggregation that computes the weighted average of numeric values that are extracted from the aggregated documents.
These values can be extracted either from specific numeric fields in the documents.

When calculating a regular average, each datapoint has an equal "weight" ... it contributes equally to the final value. Weighted averages,
on the other hand, weight each datapoint differently. The amount that each datapoint contributes to the final value is extracted from the
document.

As a formula, a weighted average is the `∑(value * weight) / ∑(weight)`

A regular average can be thought of as a weighted average where every value has an implicit weight of `1`.

==== Examples

If our documents have a `"grade"` field that holds a 0-100 numeric score, and a `"weight"` field which holds an arbitrary numeric weight,
we can calculate the weighted average using:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
POST /exams/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "weighted_grade": {
      "weighted_avg": {
        "value": {
          "field": "grade"
        },
        "weight": {
          "field": "weight"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// TEST[setup:exams]

Which yields a response like:

[source,console-result]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  ...
  "aggregations": {
    "weighted_grade": {
      "value": 70.0
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// TESTRESPONSE[s/\.\.\./"took": $body.took,"timed_out": false,"_shards": $body._shards,"hits": $body.hits,/]


While multiple values-per-field are allowed, only one weight is allowed. If the aggregation encounters
a document that has more than one weight (e.g. the weight field is a multi-valued field) it will abort the search.
If you have this situation, you should build a <<search-aggregations-metrics-weight-avg-aggregation-runtime-field>>
to combine those values into a single weight.

This single weight will be applied independently to each value extracted from the `value` field.

This example show how a single document with multiple values will be averaged with a single weight:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
POST /exams/_doc?refresh
{
  "grade": [1, 2, 3],
  "weight": 2
}

POST /exams/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "weighted_grade": {
      "weighted_avg": {
        "value": {
          "field": "grade"
        },
        "weight": {
          "field": "weight"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// TEST

The three values (`1`, `2`, and `3`) will be included as independent values, all with the weight of `2`:

[source,console-result]
--------------------------------------------------
{
  ...
  "aggregations": {
    "weighted_grade": {
      "value": 2.0
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// TESTRESPONSE[s/\.\.\./"took": $body.took,"timed_out": false,"_shards": $body._shards,"hits": $body.hits,/]

The aggregation returns `2.0` as the result, which matches what we would expect when calculating by hand:
`((1*2) + (2*2) + (3*2)) / (2+2+2) == 2`

[[search-aggregations-metrics-weight-avg-aggregation-runtime-field]]
==== Runtime field

If you have to sum or weigh values that don't quite line up with the indexed
values, run the aggregation on a <<runtime,runtime field>>.

[source,console]
----
POST /exams/_doc?refresh
{
  "grade": 100,
  "weight": [2, 3]
}
POST /exams/_doc?refresh
{
  "grade": 80,
  "weight": 3
}

POST /exams/_search?filter_path=aggregations
{
  "size": 0,
  "runtime_mappings": {
    "weight.combined": {
      "type": "double",
      "script": """
        double s = 0;
        for (double w : doc['weight']) {
          s += w;
        }
        emit(s);
      """
    }
  },
  "aggs": {
    "weighted_grade": {
      "weighted_avg": {
        "value": {
          "script": "doc.grade.value + 1"
        },
        "weight": {
          "field": "weight.combined"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

Which should look like:

[source,console-result]
----
{
  "aggregations": {
    "weighted_grade": {
      "value": 93.5
    }
  }
}
----


==== Missing values

The `missing` parameter defines how documents that are missing a value should be treated.
The default behavior is different for `value` and `weight`:

By default, if the `value` field is missing the document is ignored and the aggregation moves on to the next document.
If the `weight` field is missing, it is assumed to have a weight of `1` (like a normal average).

Both of these defaults can be overridden with the `missing` parameter:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
POST /exams/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "weighted_grade": {
      "weighted_avg": {
        "value": {
          "field": "grade",
          "missing": 2
        },
        "weight": {
          "field": "weight",
          "missing": 3
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
