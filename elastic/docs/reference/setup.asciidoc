[[supported-platforms]]
[float]
== Supported platforms

The matrix of officially supported operating systems and JVMs is available here:
link:/support/matrix[Support Matrix]. Elasticsearch is tested on the listed
platforms, but it is possible that it will work on other platforms too.

[float]
[[jvm-version]]
== Java (JVM) Version

Elasticsearch is built using Java, and requires at least
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java {jdk_major}]
in order to run. Only Oracle's Java and the OpenJDK are supported. The same JVM
version should be used on all Elasticsearch nodes and clients.

We recommend installing Java version *{jdk} or a later version in the Java
{jdk_major} release series*. We recommend using a
link:/support/matrix[supported]
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/eol-135779.html[LTS version of Java].
Elasticsearch will refuse to start if a known-bad version of Java is used.

The version of Java that Elasticsearch will use can be configured by setting
the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.
