=== Minhash Token Filter

A token filter of type `min_hash` hashes each token of the token stream and divides
the resulting hashes into buckets, keeping the lowest-valued hashes per
bucket. It then returns these hashes as tokens.

The following are settings that can be set for a `min_hash` token filter.

|`hash_set_size` |The number of minhashes to keep per bucket. Defaults to `1`.

|`with_rotation` |Whether or not to fill empty buckets with the value of the first non-empty
