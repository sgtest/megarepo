=== Common Grams Token Filter

Token filter that generates bigrams for frequently occurring terms.
Single terms are still indexed. It can be used as an alternative to the
<<analysis-stop-tokenfilter,Stop
Token Filter>> when we don't want to completely ignore common terms.

For example, the text "the quick brown is a fox" will be tokenized as
"the", "the_quick", "quick", "brown", "brown_is", "is_a", "a_fox",
"fox". Assuming "the", "is" and "a" are common words.

When `query_mode` is enabled, the token filter removes common words and
single terms followed by a common word. This parameter should be enabled
in the search analyzer.

For example, the query "the quick brown is a fox" will be tokenized as
"the_quick", "quick", "brown_is", "is_a", "a_fox", "fox".

The following are settings that can be set:

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Setting |Description
|`common_words` |A list of common words to use.

|`common_words_path` |A path (either relative to `config` location, or
absolute) to a list of common words. Each word should be in its own
"line" (separated by a line break). The file must be UTF-8 encoded.

|`ignore_case` |If true, common words matching will be case insensitive
(defaults to `false`).

|`query_mode` |Generates bigrams then removes common words and single
terms followed by a common word (defaults to `false`).
|=======================================================================

Note, `common_words` or `common_words_path` field is required.

Here is an example:
