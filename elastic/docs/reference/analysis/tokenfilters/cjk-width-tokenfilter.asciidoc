=== CJK Width Token Filter

The `cjk_width` token filter normalizes CJK width differences:

* Folds fullwidth ASCII variants into the equivalent basic Latin
* Folds halfwidth Katakana variants into the equivalent Kana

NOTE: This token filter can be viewed as a subset of NFKC/NFKD
Unicode normalization.  See the {plugins}/analysis-icu-normalization-charfilter.html[`analysis-icu` plugin]
for full normalization support.
