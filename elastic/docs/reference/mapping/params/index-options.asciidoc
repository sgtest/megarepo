[[index-options]]
=== `index_options`

The `index_options` parameter controls what information is added to the
inverted index for search and highlighting purposes.

[WARNING]
====
The `index_options` parameter is intended for use with <<text,`text`>> fields
only. Avoid using `index_options` with other field data types.
====

It accepts the following values:

`docs`::
Only the doc number is indexed.  Can answer the question _Does this term
exist in this field?_

`freqs`::
Doc number and term frequencies are indexed.  Term frequencies are used to
score repeated terms higher than single terms.

`positions` (default)::
Doc number, term frequencies, and term positions (or order) are indexed.
Positions can be used for
<<query-dsl-match-query-phrase,proximity or phrase queries>>.

`offsets`::
Doc number, term frequencies, positions, and start and end character
offsets (which map the term back to the original string) are indexed.
Offsets are used by the <<unified-highlighter,unified highlighter>> to speed up highlighting.

    "properties": {
      "text": {
        "type": "text",
        "index_options": "offsets"

PUT my_index/_doc/1
{
  "text": "Quick brown fox"
}

GET my_index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "text": "brown fox"
    }
  },
  "highlight": {
    "fields": {
      "text": {} <1>
    }
  }
}
--------------------------------------------------

<1> The `text` field will use the postings for the highlighting by default because `offsets` are indexed.
