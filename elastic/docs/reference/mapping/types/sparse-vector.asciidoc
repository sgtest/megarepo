[[sparse-vector]]
=== Sparse vector datatype

experimental[]

A `sparse_vector` field stores sparse vectors of float values.
The maximum number of dimensions that can be in a vector should
not exceed 500. The number of dimensions can be
different across documents. A `sparse_vector` field is
a single-valued field.

These vectors can be used for <<vector-functions,document scoring>>.
For example, a document score can represent a distance between
a given query vector and the indexed document vector.

You represent a sparse vector as an object, where object fields
are dimensions, and fields values are values for these dimensions.
Dimensions are integer values from `0` to `65535` encoded as strings.
Dimensions don't need to be in order.

// CONSOLE

Internally, each document's sparse vector is encoded as a binary
doc value. Its size in bytes is equal to
`6 * NUMBER_OF_DIMENSIONS`, where `NUMBER_OF_DIMENSIONS` -
number of the vector's dimensions.
