[[match-only-text-field-type]]
=== Match-only text field type

A variant of <<text-field-type,`text`>> that trades scoring and efficiency of
positional queries for space efficiency. This field effectively stores data the
same way as a `text` field that only indexes documents (`index_options: docs`)
and disables norms (`norms: false`). Term queries perform as fast if not faster
as on `text` fields, however queries that need positions such as the
<<query-dsl-match-query-phrase,`match_phrase` query>> perform slower as they
need to look at the `_source` document to verify whether a phrase matches. All
queries return constant scores that are equal to 1.0.

Analysis is not configurable: text is always analyzed with the
<<specify-index-time-default-analyzer,default analyzer>>
(<<analysis-standard-analyzer,`standard`>> by default).

<<span-queries,span queries>> are not supported with this field, use
<<query-dsl-intervals-query,interval queries>> instead, or the
<<text-field-type,`text`>> field type if you absolutely need span queries.

Other than that, `match_only_text` supports the same queries as `text`. And
like `text`, it doesn't support sorting or aggregating.

[[match-only-text-params]]
==== Parameters for match-only text fields

The following mapping parameters are accepted:

[horizontal]

<<multi-fields,`fields`>>::

    Multi-fields allow the same string value to be indexed in multiple ways for
    different purposes, such as one field for search and a multi-field for
    sorting and aggregations, or the same string value analyzed by different
    analyzers.

<<mapping-field-meta,`meta`>>::

    Metadata about the field.
