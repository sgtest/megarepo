=== Point field type

The `point` data type facilitates the indexing of and searching
arbitrary `x, y` pairs that fall in a 2-dimensional planar
coordinate system.

You can query documents using this type using
<<query-dsl-shape-query,shape Query>>.

There are five ways that a point may be specified, as demonstrated below:

[source,console]
--------------------------------------------------
PUT my-index-000001
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "location": {
        "type": "point"
      }
    }
  }
}

PUT my-index-000001/_doc/1
{
  "text": "Point as an object with 'x' and 'y' keys",
  "location": { <1>
    "x": -71.34,
    "y": 41.12
  }
}

PUT my-index-000001/_doc/2
{
  "text": "Point as an object using GeoJSON format",
  "location": { <2>
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [-71.34, 41.12]
  }
}

PUT my-index-000001/_doc/3
{
  "text": "Point as a string",
  "location": "-71.34,41.12" <3>
}

PUT my-index-000001/_doc/4
{
  "text": "Point as an array",
  "location": [ -71.34, 41.12 ] <4>
}

PUT my-index-000001/_doc/5
{
  "text": "Point as a WKT POINT primitive",
  "location" : "POINT (-71.34 41.12)" <5>
}

--------------------------------------------------

<1> Point expressed as an object, with `x` and `y` keys.
<2> Point expressed as an object, in https://geojson.org/[GeoJSON] format, with `type` and `coordinates` keys.
<3> Point expressed as a string with the format: `"x,y"`.
<4> Point expressed as an array with the format: [ `x`, `y`]
<5> Point expressed as a https://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/12-063r5/12-063r5.html[Well-Known Text]
POINT with the format: `"POINT(x y)"`

[NOTE]
Unlike the case with the {ref}/geo-point.html[geo-point] field type,
the order of the coordinates `x` and `y` is the same for all formats above.

The coordinates provided to the indexer are single precision floating point values so
the field guarantees the same accuracy provided by the java virtual machine (typically
`1E-38`).

[[point-params]]
==== Parameters for `point` fields

The following parameters are accepted by `point` fields:

[horizontal]

<<ignore-malformed,`ignore_malformed`>>::

    If `true`, malformed points are ignored. If `false` (default),
    malformed points throw an exception and reject the whole document.

`ignore_z_value`::

    If `true` (default) three dimension points will be accepted (stored in source)
    but only x and y values will be indexed; the third dimension is
    ignored. If `false`, points containing any more than x and y
    (two dimensions) values throw an exception and reject the whole document.

<<null-value,`null_value`>>::

    Accepts an point value which is substituted for any explicit `null` values.
    Defaults to `null`, which means the field is treated as missing.

==== Sorting and retrieving points

It is currently not possible to sort points or retrieve their fields
directly. The `point` value is only retrievable through the `_source`
field.
