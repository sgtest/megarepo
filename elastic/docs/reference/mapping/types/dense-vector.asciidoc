[[dense-vector]]
=== Dense vector datatype

experimental[]

A `dense_vector` field stores dense vectors of float values.
The maximum number of dimensions that can be in a vector should
not exceed 500. The number of dimensions can be
different across documents. A `dense_vector` field is
a single-valued field.

These vectors can be used for <<vector-functions,document scoring>>.
For example, a document score can represent a distance between
a given query vector and the indexed document vector.

You index a dense vector as an array of floats.

// CONSOLE

Internally, each document's dense vector is encoded as a binary
doc value. Its size in bytes is equal to
`4 * NUMBER_OF_DIMENSIONS`, where `NUMBER_OF_DIMENSIONS` -
number of the vector's dimensions.
