=== Synopsis

[source,shell]
----
bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token
[-f, --force] [-h, --help] [-E <KeyValuePair>] [-s, --scope]
----

=== Description

Use this command to create enrollment tokens, which you can use to enroll new
{es} nodes to an existing cluster or configure {kib} instances to communicate
with an existing {es} cluster that has security features enabled.
The command generates (and subsequently removes) a temporary user in the
<<file-realm,file realm>> to run the request that creates enrollment tokens.
IMPORTANT: You cannot use this tool if the file realm is disabled in your 
`elasticsearch.yml` file.

This command uses an HTTP connection to connect to the cluster and run the user
management requests. The command automatically attempts to establish the connection
over HTTPS by using the `xpack.security.http.ssl` settings in
the `elasticsearch.yml` file. If you do not use the default configuration directory,
ensure that the `ES_PATH_CONF` environment variable returns the
correct path before you run the `elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token` command. You can
override settings in your `elasticsearch.yml` file by using the `-E` command
option. For more information about debugging connection failures, see
<<trb-security-setup>>.
