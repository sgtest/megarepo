= Generating alerts for {transforms}

beta::[]

{kib} {alert-features} include support for {transform} rules, which check the 
health of {ctransforms} with certain conditions. If the conditions of the rule 
are met, an alert is created and the associated action is triggered. For 
example, you can create a rule to check if a {ctransform} is started and to 
notify you in an email if it is not. To learn more about {kib} {alert-features}, 
refer to 
{kibana-ref}/alerting-getting-started.html#alerting-getting-started[Alerting].

The following {transform} rules are available:

{transform-cap} health:: 
  Monitors {transforms} health and alerts if an operational issue occurred.

== Creating a rule

You can create {transform} rules under **{stack-manage-app} > {rules-ui}**.

On the *Create rule* window, give a name to the rule and optionally provide 
tags. Select the {transform} health rule type:

=== {transform-cap} health

Select the {transform} or {transforms} to include. You can also use a special 
character (`*`) to apply the rule to all your {transforms}. {transforms-cap} 
created after the rule are automatically included.

The following health check is available and enabled by default:

_{transform-cap} is not started_:: 
  Notifies if the corresponding {transforms} is not started or it does not index 
  any data. The notification message recommends the necessary actions to solve 
  the error.

_Errors in {transform} messages_:: 
  Notifies if {transform} messages contain errors.

As the last step in the rule creation process, define its actions.

It's also possible to customize the notification messages for each action. A
list of variables is available to include in the message, like {transform} ID,
description, {transform} state, and so on.

After you save the configurations, the rule appears in the *{rules-ui}* list 
where you can check its status and see the overview of its configuration 
information.

The name of an alert is always the same as the {transform} ID of the associated 
{transform} that triggered it. You can mute the notifications for a particular 
{transform} on the page of the rule that lists the individual alerts. You can 
open it via *{rules-ui}* by selecting the rule name.
