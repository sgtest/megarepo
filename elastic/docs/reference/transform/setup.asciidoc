To use the {transforms}, you must have the
{subscriptions}[appropriate license] and at least one
<<transform-setup-nodes,{transform} node>> in your {es} cluster. If {stack}
{security-features} are enabled, you must also ensure your users have the
<<transform-privileges,necessary privileges>>.

[[transform-setup-nodes]]
==== {transform-cap} nodes

To use {transforms}, there must be at least one node in your cluster with
`xpack.transform.enabled` and `node.transform` set to `true`. By default, all
nodes are {transform} nodes unless you explicitly change these settings or set 
`node.data` to `false`.

If you want to control which nodes run {transforms}, set `node.transform` to
`false` on some nodes.

For more information, see <<transform-settings>> and <<modules-node>>.

[[transform-privileges]]
==== Security privileges

The {es} {security-features} provide <<built-in-roles,built-in roles>>
and <<security-privileges,privileges>> that make it easier to control
which users can manage or view {transforms}. 

For example, you need `manage_transform` cluster privileges to preview and
create {transforms}. Members of the built-in `transform_admin` role have these 
privileges. You also need `read` and `view_index_metadata` index privileges on
the source index and `read`, `create_index`, and `index` privileges on the
destination index.
