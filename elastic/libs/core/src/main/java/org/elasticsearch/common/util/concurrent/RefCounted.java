 *  An interface for objects that need to be notified when all reference

 *  but should be functional until all async operations have joined
 *  Classes implementing this interface should ref counted at any time ie. if an object is used it's reference count should
 *  be increased before using it by calling #incRef and a corresponding #decRef must be called in a try/finally
 *  block to release the object again ie.:
 * <pre>
