# --description--

Let's use `do` to ask about daily routines.

When you use `do` as an auxiliary verb in a question, the main verb must stay in its base form. 예시:

Statement: `She works as a Full Stack dev.`

Question: `Does she work as a Full Stack dev?`

Notice in the example above that `work` doesn't change to `works`, even when asking about a third person singular subject like `he,` `she,` or `it.`
