# --description--

A `class` is a fundamental concept, especially in object-oriented programming. It acts like a blueprint for creating objects. A `class` defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (`methods`) that the objects created from the `class` can have.

For example, a `Person` class might have properties like `name` and `age`, and behaviors like `talk()` and `walk()`.

A `method` is a function that is associated with an object. `Methods` define the behaviors or actions that an object created from a `class` can perform. They are like instructions that tell the object what to do.

For instance, in a `Calculator class`, a `method` might be `add(number1, number2)`, which adds two numbers together.
