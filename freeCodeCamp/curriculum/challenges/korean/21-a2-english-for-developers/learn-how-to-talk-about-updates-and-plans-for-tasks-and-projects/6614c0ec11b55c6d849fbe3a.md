<!--
AUDIO REFERENCE:
Bob: Well, I think we should use a slide deck for the presentation. It's the standard format, and it will make the information more accessible.
Sarah: True, but I was thinking we could try something different. Let's use an interactive demo instead of slides. It will engage the audience more effectively.
