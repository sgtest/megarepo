# --description--

`Gracefully` means dealing with problems in a smooth, efficient, and not abrupt way. When a program handles errors `gracefully`, it manages issues without crashing or causing major disruptions. For example, instead of stopping suddenly, a program might show a helpful error message.

Remember, `encounter` means to come across something unexpectedly, and a `conditional statement` is a code that runs only if a certain condition is true.
