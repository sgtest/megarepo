<!--
AUDIO REFERENCE:
Brian: Which framework are you working with?
-->

# --description--

The word `which` is used to ask for specific information among a set of known options. For example, when someone asks, `Which book did you read?` They want to know the specific book out of several possible ones.

In a technical context, asking `Which software are you using?` is asking for a specific software name from known options.
