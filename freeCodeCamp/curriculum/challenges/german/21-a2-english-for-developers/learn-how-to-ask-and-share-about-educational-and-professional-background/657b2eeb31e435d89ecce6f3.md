# --description--

In this task, you'll learn about the word `actual`. It's an adjective, which is a type of word that describes something. When you say `actual`, you're talking about what something is really like. For instance, when you talk about `the actual color`, you mean the real color of something.

Often, you can add `-ly` to an adjective to make it an adverb. Adverbs are words that tell us how something is said or done. So, when you add `-ly` to `actual`, you get `actually`, which is an adverb.

Read the sentence below and place the words `actual`and `actually` in the correct place.
