# --description--

`FAQ` stands for `Frequently Asked Questions`. It's a list of questions and answers about a particular topic, often found on websites or product manuals. For example, `The software's FAQ page helps users troubleshoot common issues.`

`Based on` is a phrase used to show that something is made using certain information or ideas. In tech, you might say, `This update is based on user suggestions.`

To `attend` means to go to or be present at an event or meeting. In a professional setting, `attending` training can mean participating in a session to learn new skills. For instance, `I attended a webinar on cybersecurity.`

These terms are commonly used in professional and technical contexts.
