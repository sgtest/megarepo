# --description--

This task will help you understand and use terms related to presentation techniques. An `interactive` element in a presentation involves audience participation or allows them to influence the course of the presentation. For example, `The interactive quiz in the presentation kept everyone engaged.`

A `demo`, short for demonstration, is a practical display or explanation of how something works. In the context of presentations, a `demo` might involve showing a product or software feature in action. Like saying, `The software demo helped the clients understand its features.`
