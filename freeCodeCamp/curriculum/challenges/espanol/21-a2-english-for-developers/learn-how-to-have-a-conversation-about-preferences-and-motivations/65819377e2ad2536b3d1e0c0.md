# --description--

When people `try to beat each other`, they are competing or trying to be better than the others, often in a way that is not friendly or cooperative.

`Working together as a team` means cooperating with others, sharing tasks, and helping each other to achieve a common goal. It's the opposite of competing; it's about helping and supporting.
