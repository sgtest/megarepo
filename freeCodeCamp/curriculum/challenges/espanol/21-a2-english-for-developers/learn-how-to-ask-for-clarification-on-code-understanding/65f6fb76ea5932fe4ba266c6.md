AUDIO REFERENCE:
Brian: Understood. We can investigate this together, and by the end of it, we should have a clearer picture of what's happening.

# --description--

`By the end of it` means at the end.

 `A clearer picture` metaphorically means a better or more complete understanding. It's like when you clean your glasses and suddenly see things more clearly.

An Example of `a clearer picture`:

`After studying, I have a clearer picture of the math problem.`
