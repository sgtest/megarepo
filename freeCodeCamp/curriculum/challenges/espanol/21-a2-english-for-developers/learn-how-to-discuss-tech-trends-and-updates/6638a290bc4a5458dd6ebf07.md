# --description--

The word `actually` is often used to express a fact or to correct a previous statement or assumption. It adds emphasis to what is being said and can introduce new, often surprising information.

For example, `She isn't just my colleague; she's actually my sister.`

The phrase `think of` is used to express the idea of considering or planning to do something. When using `think of`, it is common to follow it with a verb in its `-ing` form (gerund). This structure is used to talk about possible actions or intentions.

For instance, `I'm thinking of starting a new project.` It means considering starting something new.
