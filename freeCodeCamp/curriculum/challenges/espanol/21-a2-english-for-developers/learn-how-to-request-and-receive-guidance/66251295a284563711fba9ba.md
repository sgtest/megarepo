# --description--

`Missing` implies that something is absent or lacking. In coding, feeling like you're `missing something` can mean there's a gap in your understanding or a missing piece in the code.

To `tackle` a challenge means to confront or take on a difficult task. It's like saying, `I tackled the difficult problem,` which means you worked on solving it, even if it was hard.
