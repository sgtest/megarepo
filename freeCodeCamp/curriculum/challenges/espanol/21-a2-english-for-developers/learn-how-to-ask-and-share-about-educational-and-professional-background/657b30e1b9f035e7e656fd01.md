<!-- (Audio) Anna: I saw that tech companies appreciate innovation and care for the employees’ well-being. -->

# --description--

An `employee` is someone who works for a company or a person. When you talk about `employees' well-being`, you are talking about the health and happiness of all the people who work there. The `'s` after `employees` means that the well-being belongs to the employees. It's like `the cat's toy` (one cat) and `the cats' toy` (more than one cat).
