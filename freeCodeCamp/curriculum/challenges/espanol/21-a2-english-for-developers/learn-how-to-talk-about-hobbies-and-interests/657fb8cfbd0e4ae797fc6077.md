# --description--

The term `community` is used to describe a group of people with common interests, activities, or goals. It often implies a sense of belonging and shared experiences.

When you talk about more than one group of such people, you use the plural form by changing `y` at the end to `ies`, So, `community` becomes `communities`.

 For example, if there are many groups of people who love reading books, you can say `There are many reading communities.`
