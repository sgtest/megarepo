# --description--

If something is `familiar`, it means you know it or recognize it because you have seen or experienced it before. For example, `familiar software` is software you have used or learned about previously.

`Unfamiliar` is the opposite, referring to something you do not know or recognize, like `unfamiliar terminology`.

`Valuable` means something is very useful or important. In the context of work or study, a `valuable resource` is something that provides a lot of help or information, like `valuable feedback`.
