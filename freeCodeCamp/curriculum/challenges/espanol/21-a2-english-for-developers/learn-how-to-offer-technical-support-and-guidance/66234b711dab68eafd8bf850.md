# --description--

`To isolate` in this context means to separate or single out something in order to understand or deal with it more effectively. For example, `Isolating a variable in an experiment helps to understand its effects.`

The `root cause` is the fundamental reason for the occurrence of a problem. Identifying the `root cause` in programming means finding the main reason why an error or issue is happening. For instance, `Identifying the root cause of a system failure can prevent future issues.`

`Behavior` in software refers to how a system, program, or function operates or responds under certain conditions.
