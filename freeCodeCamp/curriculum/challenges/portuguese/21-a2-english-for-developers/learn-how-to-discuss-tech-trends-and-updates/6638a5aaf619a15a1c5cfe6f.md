# --description--

`Code analysis` refers to the process of examining and evaluating the source code in programming. It's a technique used to find errors, improve code quality, and ensure that coding standards are met. `Code analysis` can be done manually by programmers or automatically using tools.

`Bug detection` in programming refers to the process of identifying and fixing bugs or errors in the code. Bugs can cause a program to crash, produce incorrect results, or behave unpredictably. Effective `bug detection` is crucial for creating reliable and efficient software. Tools and methods like automated testing, code reviews, and using AI for analysis can greatly assist in this process.
