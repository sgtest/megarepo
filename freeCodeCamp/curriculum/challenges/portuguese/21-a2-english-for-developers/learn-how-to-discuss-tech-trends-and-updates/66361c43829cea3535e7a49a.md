# --description--

The phrase `why don't` is often used to make a suggestion or offer. It is followed by a subject (like `we`, `you`, or `they`) and a base verb. The structure is `why don't + subject + base verb`. It's a polite way of suggesting an action or asking someone to do something.

Exemplos:

`Why don't we go to the cinema tonight?` The speaker suggests going to the cinema.

`Why don't you try restarting the computer?` The speaker suggests restarting the computer as a solution.

The phrase `check out` means to examine or look at something more closely, commonly used when suggesting to explore or learn more about something. For instance, `Let's check out the new restaurant` implies visiting and trying the restaurant.
