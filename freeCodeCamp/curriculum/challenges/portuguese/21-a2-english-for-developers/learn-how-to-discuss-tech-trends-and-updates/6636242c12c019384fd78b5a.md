# --description--

Please answer the question below.

# --question--

## --text--

Does Brian agree with Sarah's suggestion, and why?

No, because he thinks it's a waste of time.

This option is incorrect. Brian's response `I'm on it` implies that he is already taking action, which shows agreement, not rejection.

---

Yes, because he indicates that he is already taking action on her suggestion.

---

No, he is asking for more time to think about it.

### --feedback--

---

Yes, but he suggests a different approach to exploring the tools.
