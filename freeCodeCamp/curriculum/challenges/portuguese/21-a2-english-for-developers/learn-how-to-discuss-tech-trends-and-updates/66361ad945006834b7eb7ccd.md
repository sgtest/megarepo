# --description--

Please answer the question below.

# --question--

## --text--

Which words or expressions does Brian use to make a suggestion?

## --answers--

`I see, we try it`

### --feedback--

This option misses the key modal and adverb that soften the suggestion and express possibility.

---

`We have, requires`

### --feedback--

These words describe the project but do not contribute to the formulation of the suggestion itself.

---

`A lot of complex work`

### --feedback--

While this describes the nature of the project, it is not part of the phrase that makes the suggestion.

---

`Maybe, could`
