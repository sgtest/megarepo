# --description--

The words you use in a sentence can make a big difference in modulating the message it delivers. Let's look at some examples to understand this better.

Prepositions like `by` affect the verb that comes after, When you use `by`, it often needs the verb to end with `-ing`. Exemplo:

`I improved by practicing daily` (This means I got better at something because I practiced every day. You use the preposition `by` to show how something is done)

Adjectives can also change the meaning of the following word by adding details to them. The word `light` can serve as an adjective to describe something not heavy or not intense. Por exemplo:

`Light exercises are good for beginners.` This means exercises that are not heavy or hard are good for people who are just starting. The word `light` as an adjective tells you what kind of exercises they are.

Even words like `family` and `outdoor` can be used as adjectives, they describe the noun that follows them. Por exemplo:

`Family activities bring everyone together.` (`family` describes the type of activities) `Outdoor sports are enjoyable in good weather.` (`outdoor` describes where the sports happen)
