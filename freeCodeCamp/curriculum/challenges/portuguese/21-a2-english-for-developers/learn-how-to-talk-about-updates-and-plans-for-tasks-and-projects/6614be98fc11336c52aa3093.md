# --description--

A `slide deck` is a collection of slides put together for a presentation, often created using software like PowerPoint or Google Slides. It's like a digital version of a stack of cards, each slide containing part of the presentation's content.

For example, `We prepared a slide deck for the meeting to showcase our project's progress.`

The term `standard` refers to something that is commonly used or accepted as a norm. In this context, `standard format` means a format that is widely used and recognized. For example, `Using bullet points for key points is a standard practice in presentations.`
