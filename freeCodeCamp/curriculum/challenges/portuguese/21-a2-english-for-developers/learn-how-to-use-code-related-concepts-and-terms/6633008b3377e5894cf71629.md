## --text--

How does Sarah describe functions in her explanation?

## --answers--

As small, reusable tasks that can be used multiple times in code

As large, complex operations that are difficult to manage

### --feedback--

This choice is incorrect. Sarah specifically mentions that functions are small and reusable, not large and complex.

---

As one-time use commands that are not saved

### --feedback--

This is not right. Sarah describes functions as reusable, meaning they can be used more than once.

---

As unnecessary parts of programming that should be avoided
