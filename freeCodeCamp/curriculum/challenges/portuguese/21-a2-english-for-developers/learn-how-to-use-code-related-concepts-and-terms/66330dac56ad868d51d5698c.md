A `comment` is a note or explanation added to the code by the programmer. Comments are not executed as part of the program; instead, they help anyone reading the code understand its purpose, functionality, or any specific details. They're essential for making code readable and maintainable.

For example, `// This is a single-line comment in JavaScript.`
