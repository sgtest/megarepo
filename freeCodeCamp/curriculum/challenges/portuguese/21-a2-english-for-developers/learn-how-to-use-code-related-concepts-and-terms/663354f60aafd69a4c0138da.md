# --description--

The `equals symbol` (`=`) is commonly used for assignment. It's used to assign a value to a variable. The variable name is written on the left of the equals symbol, and the value you want to store in the variable is on the right.

For example, `name = "Sophia";` assigns the string `"Sophia"` to the variable `name`.

To `assign a value` in programming means to give a specific value to a variable. The `equals symbol` (`=`) is commonly used for this purpose. When you assign a value to a variable, you are telling the program to remember that value for use later.

For example, `age = 25` assigns the value `25` to the variable `age`.
