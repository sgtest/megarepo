# --description--

The modal verb `can` is used to indicate possibility or ability. For example, in the sentence `You can see the stars at night`, `can` shows that it is possible to see the stars during nighttime.

`Change` means to make or become different. In everyday life, you might `change` your clothes after work, indicating you switch from work clothes to casual ones.

`Stay the same` means to remain unchanged or constant. For example, `The rules of the game stay the same every year.` This means the rules do not alter from one year to the next.
