AUDIO REFERENCE:
Sophia: Think of variables as containers you can fill and empty, and constants as locked boxes that keep the same contents.

# --description--

Please answer the question below.

# --question--

## --text--

Which sentence accurately describes the difference between variables and constants as explained by Sophia?

## --answers--

Variables are flexible storage units, while constants are secure storage units that cannot be altered.

### --feedback--

This option, while somewhat accurate, doesn't fully capture the metaphor of filling and emptying versus locked boxes that Sophia used.

---

Variables can store multiple types of data at once, whereas constants can only store one type.

### --feedback--

This statement is misleading because it focuses on the types of data rather than how the data can be altered or remains fixed, which is the main point of Sophiaâ€™s explanation.

---

Variables act as containers that can be filled and emptied, while constants act as locked boxes that keep unchanged contents.

---

Variables are always changing, and constants are never used more than once.

### --feedback--

This option is incorrect as it suggests constants are never used more than once, which is not true. They are used repeatedly but their values do not change.
