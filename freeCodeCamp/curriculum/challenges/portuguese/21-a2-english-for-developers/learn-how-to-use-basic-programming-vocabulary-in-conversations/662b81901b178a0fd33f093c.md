Please answer the question below.

# --question--

## --text--

How do you declare a variable in Python according to Sophie?

## --answers--

You declare a variable by naming it after an operator.

### --feedback--

This choice is incorrect, because the variable is not named after, but before, an operator.

---

Variables are declared by using a command called `declare`.

### --feedback--

Python does not require a special command like `declare` to create variables; it uses assignment directly.

---

You use the variable name followed by the assignment operator and a value.

---

Variables must be declared by typing `variable` before the name.

### --feedback--

Python does not use any keywords like `variable` to declare variables. It simply uses the variable name, the assignment operator, and the value.
