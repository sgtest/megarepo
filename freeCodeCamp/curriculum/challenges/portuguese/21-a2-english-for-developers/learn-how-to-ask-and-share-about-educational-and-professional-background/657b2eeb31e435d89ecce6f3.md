# --description--

You'll learn about `actual` in this task. It's a describing word (adjective). It means what something is really like. For example, `the actual color` means the real color. You often add `-ly` to an adjective to form an adverb. This rule helps change many describing words into words that tell people how something is said or done. Here, you add `-ly` to `actual` and it's the adverb `actually`.
