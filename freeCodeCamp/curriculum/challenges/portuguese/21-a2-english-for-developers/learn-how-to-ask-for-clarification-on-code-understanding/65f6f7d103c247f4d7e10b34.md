# --description--

The word `clear` means easy to understand or see. When you want to compare something and show it is more `clear`, you add `er` at the end to make `clearer`.

Por exemplo:

- This explanation is `clear`.
- This explanation is `clearer` than the other one.

Notice how `clearer` is used to compare two things, indicating that one is more easy to understand than the other.
