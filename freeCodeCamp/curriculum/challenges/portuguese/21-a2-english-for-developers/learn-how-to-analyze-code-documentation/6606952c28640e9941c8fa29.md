# --description--

Usually, `with` is used to show connection or use. For example, `I write with a pen.` However, in some sentences, `with` comes at the end. This usually happens when you want to emphasize the object or thing someone is using or dealing with, especially in questions or statements about technology or work.

For instance, in tech, you might say, `This program I work with is challenging.` Here, `with` is used at the end to emphasize the program that is challenging to work with. Another example could be a question like, `What else is he working with?` where `with` at the end asks about other tools or technologies being used.
