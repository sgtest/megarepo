# --description--

An `API` (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and tools for building software applications. It's like a bridge that allows different software programs to communicate with each other. For example, `The weather app uses an API to get data from the weather service.`

An `approach` is a way of considering or doing something. Like, `Her approach to solving the problem was very creative.`
