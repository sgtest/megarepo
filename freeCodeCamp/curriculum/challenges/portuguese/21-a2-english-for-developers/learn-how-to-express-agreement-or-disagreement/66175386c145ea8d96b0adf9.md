# --description--

Understanding how to communicate disagreements `respectfully` is key in maintaining a positive and constructive work environment.

`Respectfully` is an adverb that means doing something with respect or showing respect towards someone or something.

It comes from the verb `respect`, which means to admire or show consideration for someone or something.

When you add `-ful` to `respect`, you get the adjective `respectful`, which describes someone who shows `respect`.

Adding `-ly` to `respectful` turns it into `respectfully`, which describes how an action is done with `respect`.

Exemplos:

`I respect your opinion.` This means you admire or value someone's opinion.

`She was respectful during the meeting.` This describes her behavior in the meeting as showing `respect` towards others.

`He disagreed, but he did so respectfully.` This means he showed disagreement in a way that was polite and showed `respect` towards others' opinions.
