<!--
AUDIO REFERENCE: 

Entire Dialogue:
Tom: Hey Sarah, I saw your comment on the issue I opened. Thanks for your help.
Sarah: No problem, Tom. I noticed the issue you mentioned, and I’ve already tried a few things to solve it.
Tom: That's great. What did you find?
Sarah: Well, I was investigating the code when I saw that the problem might be related to the recent updates. I tried rolling back to the previous version, but it didn't fix the issue.
Tom: I see. We might have to talk to the team to see if they can help us.
Sarah: Agreed. I’ll create a PR with the rollback and some additional logs for debugging. That may help us find what the problem is.
