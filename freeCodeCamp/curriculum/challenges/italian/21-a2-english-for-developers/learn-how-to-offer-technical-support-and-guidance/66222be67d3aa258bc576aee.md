# --description--

The expression `first things first` is used to emphasize that important things should be done before anything else. It's often said at the beginning of a task to focus on the most important steps first. For example, `First things first, let's review the project plan` means to start with reviewing the plan before moving to other tasks.

An `environment`, in a technological context, often refers to a set of software and hardware conditions in which a system operates. For example, a `development environment` is where programmers write and test their code.
