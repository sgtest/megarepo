# --description--

`To merge branches` in version control systems like Git means combining the changes from one branch into another. For example, `merging a feature branch into the main branch` means adding the new feature to the main code.

`To deal with` something means to handle or manage it, especially a problem or challenge. For instance, `dealing with a difficult customer` means managing the situation with the customer.
