# --description--

The phrase `tight deadlines` means you have to finish your work very soon.

`Tight` here means there is not much time. `Deadlines` are the days or times you must finish your work by. When deadlines are tight, you need to work fast and well to finish everything on time.

It can make you feel like you need to hurry.
