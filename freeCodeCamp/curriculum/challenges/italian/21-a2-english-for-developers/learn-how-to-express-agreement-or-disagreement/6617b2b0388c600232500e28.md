AUDIO REFERENCE:
Bob: While Agile may allow us to adapt to changes more efficiently, I still think Waterfall would be a better option.

# --description--

When `while` is used at the beginning of a sentence, it introduces a contrasting idea or point of view. For example, `While I enjoy playing sports, I still spend most of my free time reading.` It shows a difference between enjoying sports and how time is actually spent.

The word `still` is used to emphasize that the speaker maintains their opinion. Like in `While the weather is cold, I still prefer to walk to work.`, it shows that even being cold, the speaker chooses to walk.

# --question--

## --text--

What contrasting ideas are presented by Bob?

## --answers--

Agile is efficient in adapting to changes, but Bob believes Waterfall is a better option.

---

Agile and Waterfall are both equally effective, and there's no clear preference.

### --feedback--

This choice is incorrect. The sentence shows a clear preference for Waterfall despite acknowledging Agile's efficiency.

---

Bob dislikes both Agile and Waterfall methodologies.

### --feedback--

The sentence does not suggest a dislike for both; it contrasts Agile's efficiency with a preference for Waterfall.

---

Waterfall cannot adapt to changes efficiently, unlike Agile.

### --feedback--

The contrast is not about Waterfall's inability but about a preference for it despite Agile's efficiency.
