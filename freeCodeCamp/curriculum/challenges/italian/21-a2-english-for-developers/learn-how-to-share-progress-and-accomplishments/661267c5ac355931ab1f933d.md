Being `on the right track` means going in the right direction or making good progress. For instance, in a project, if things are going as planned, you can say, `We are on the right track.`

To `hesitate` means to pause or hold back in uncertainty. In a work context, `Don't hesitate to ask for help` means you shouldn't be afraid or unsure about asking for assistance.

`Reach out` means to contact someone for help or information. For example, `If you have any questions, reach out to the tech support team.`

These expressions are commonly used in professional environments to encourage ongoing progress and open communication.
