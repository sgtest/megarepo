# --description--

A graph is called a *weighted* graph when its edges are associated with weights, representing a distance, time or other quantitative value.

In your case, these weights will be the distances between each node, or point in space. To represent a weighted graph you can modify your dictionary, using a list of tuples for each value.

The first element in the tuple will be the connected node, and the second element will be an integer number indicating the distance.

Modify `my_graph["A"]` into a list of tuples, considering the following distances:

| Edge | Weight |
| ---- | ------ |
| A-B  | 3      |
| B-C  | 4      |
| C-D  | 7      |
| D-A  | 1      |

# --hints--

Your dictionary should have 4 keys called `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`.

```js
({ test: () => assert(runPython(`
    key_list = ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
    len(my_graph) == 4 and all(key in my_graph for key in key_list)
  `))
})
```

`my_graph["A"]` should be a list of tuples.

```js
({ test: () => assert(runPython(`
    type(my_graph["A"]) is list and all(type(i) is tuple for i in my_graph["A"])
  `))
})
```

`my_graph["A"]` should be a list of tuples where the first item in the tuple is the connected node and the second item is the distance.

```js
({ test: () => assert(runPython(`
    tuples = [("B", 3), ("D", 1)]
    len(my_graph["A"]) == 2 and all(t in my_graph["A"] for t in tuples)
  `))
})
```

}

```
