<!-- (Audio) Brian: I see. Did you enjoy your time there, even if it wasn't entirely tech-focused?
Sophie: I did. -->

# --description--

In this task, you'll focus on answering questions in the simple past tense. When responding to a past simple interrogative (a question), you can answer affirmatively with `did` or negatively with `didn't`. For example, `Did you go to the party?` can be answered with `I did` (affirmative) or `I didn't` (negative). Listen to the dialogue and fill in the blanks correctly to practice this structure.
