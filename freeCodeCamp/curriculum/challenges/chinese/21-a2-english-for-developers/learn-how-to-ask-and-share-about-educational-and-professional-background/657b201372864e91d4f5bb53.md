<!-- (Audio) Brian: I studied at a small college as well and majored in information technology. -->

# --description--

When a verb ends in a consonant followed by `y`, you should change the `y` to `i` and add `ed` for the past tense. For example, `carry` becomes `carried`. Note that this rule applies when the `y` follows a consonant, not a vowel, so the simple past form of `convey` is `conveyed`. For regular verbs, you simply add `ed` to form the past tense.

# --fillInTheBlank--

`studied`

### --feedback--

This word follows the regular past simple tense formation by just adding `ed`.
