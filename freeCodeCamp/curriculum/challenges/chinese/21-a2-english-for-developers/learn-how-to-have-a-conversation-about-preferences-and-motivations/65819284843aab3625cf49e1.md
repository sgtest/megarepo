# --description--

`Working overtime` means you are working more hours than the usual time you're supposed to work. It's like if you usually work until 5 PM, but you stay until 7 PM to finish something; that's working overtime.

When something is `draining`, it makes you feel very tired, both physically and mentally, like it's taking away all your energy. Imagine if you had to carry a heavy backpack all day; by the end of the day, you'd feel drained.
