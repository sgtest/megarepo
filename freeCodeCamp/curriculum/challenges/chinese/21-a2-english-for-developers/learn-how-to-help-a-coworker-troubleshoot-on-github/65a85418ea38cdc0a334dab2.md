# --description--

`To roll back` means going back to an earlier state or version of something. For example:

`If the new app is not working, try rolling back to the old version.`

A `previous version` is an earlier form of something, like an older version of software. Let's use it in the same sentence as above:

`If the new app is not working, try rolling back to the previous version.`
