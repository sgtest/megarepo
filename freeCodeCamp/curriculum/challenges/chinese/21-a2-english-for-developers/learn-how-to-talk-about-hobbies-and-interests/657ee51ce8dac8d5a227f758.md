AUDIO REFERENCE: 
James: That's awesome! What kind of figures are you most interested in?
-->

# --description--

The word `most` is often used to show the highest degree or the greatest amount of something.

For instance, `Out of all my hobbies, I enjoy reading the most` means that you might have many hobbies, but reading is your favorite.

The phrase `interested in` means something catches your attention.

For example, if you say `I am interested in painting`, it means you like painting or enjoy learning about it.
