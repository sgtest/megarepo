## --text--

What does Brian say about the front-end development of the project?

## --answers--

`We will use React because we're planning to make development faster.`

---

`We are going to use a different technology since React is too complex for us.`

### --feedback--

This option inaccurately represents Brian's statement. He mentions React as the chosen technology due to their comfort with it, not its complexity.

---

`We're unsure about using React, but we will decide soon.`

### --feedback--

This sentence does not correctly reflect Brian's statement. He clearly indicates a plan to use React, showing no uncertainty.
