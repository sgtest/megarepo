# --description--

The word `date` can be used in different contexts. While it often refers to a romantic meeting between two people, it can also simply mean an appointment or a planned event between friends or colleagues. For example, saying `Let's set a date for our next meeting` uses `date` in a non-romantic way, referring to choosing a day for a meeting.
