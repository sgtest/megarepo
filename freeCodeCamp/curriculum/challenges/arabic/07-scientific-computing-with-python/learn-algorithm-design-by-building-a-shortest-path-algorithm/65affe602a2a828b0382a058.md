# --description--

Replace the `'age'` key with the string `'B'` and set its value to the string `'A'` to represent the connection between the nodes in both directions.

# --hints--

Your dictionary should have a `'B'` key.

```js
({ test: () => assert(__pyodide.runPython(`
    graph = __locals.get("my_graph")
    "B" in graph
  `))
})
```

Your `'B'` key should have `'A'` as the value.

```js
({ test: () => assert(__pyodide.runPython(`
    graph = __locals.get("my_graph")
    graph["B"] == "A"
  `))
})
```

Your dictionary should have an `'A'` key.

```js
({ test: () => assert(__pyodide.runPython(`
    graph = __locals.get("my_graph")
    "A" in graph
  `))
})
```

Your `'A'` key should have `'B'` as the value.

```js
({ test: () => assert(__pyodide.runPython(`
    graph = __locals.get("my_graph")
    graph["A"] == "B"
  `))
})
```

Your dictionary should have two keys.

```js
({ test: () => assert(__pyodide.runPython(`
    graph = __locals.get("my_graph")
    len(graph) == 2
  `))
})
```

my_graph = {
    'A': 'B',
    'age': 2
}
