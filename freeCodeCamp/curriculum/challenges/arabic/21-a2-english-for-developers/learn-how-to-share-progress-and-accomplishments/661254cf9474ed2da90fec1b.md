AUDIO REFERENCE:
Brian: Things are going well. Last week, I worked on improving our project's documentation. I updated the user manual and added some FAQs based on customer feedback. I also attended the customer support training session. It helped me understand the issues our customers are facing, and I learned some strategies for better addressing their concerns.
