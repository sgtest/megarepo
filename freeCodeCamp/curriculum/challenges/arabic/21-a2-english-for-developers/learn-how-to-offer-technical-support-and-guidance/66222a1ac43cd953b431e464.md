# --description--

`Onboarding` in a workplace refers to the process of introducing a new employee to their job. This includes training, learning about the company culture, and meeting team members. For example, `During your onboarding, you'll learn how our team operates.`

`To hesitate` means to pause before doing something, often because you are not sure or are nervous. In this context, saying `don't hesitate to ask` means you should feel free to ask questions without worrying. For example, `If you're unsure about the report, don't hesitate to ask for help.`
