Jake: I haven't been on a bike since I was a kid.

# --description--

In the Present Perfect Continuous Tense, to make a sentence negative, you add `not` after `have` or `has`. This way, you can talk about something that has not been happening.

For example, if Jake wants to say he hasn't been cycling since he was a child, he can say, `I have not been cycling since I was a child.` This means he did not cycle from his childhood to now.

This sentence could also be abbreviated to: `I haven't been cycling since I was a child.`
