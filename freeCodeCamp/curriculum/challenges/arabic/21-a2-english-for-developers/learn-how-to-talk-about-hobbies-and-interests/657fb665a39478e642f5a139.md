# --description--

A `marathon` is a very long race where people run 42 kilometers. It can also mean watching many movies or TV shows one after another without stopping.

A `convention` is a big meeting where people who like the same things, like comics or movies, come together to talk and learn about their hobbies.

`Movie-related` means anything that has to do with movies. For example, movie posters or toys from a movie are `movie-related`.

`Play together` means to do games or activities with other people at the same time, like playing a board game or playing soccer in a park.
