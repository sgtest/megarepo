# --description--

You should now see the same bunch of characters in your console. Your `padRow` function is doing the exact same thing you were doing earlier, but now it's in a reusable section of its own.

Use the addition operator to concatenate a blank space `" "` to the beginning and end of your repeated `character` string.

# --hints--

You should concatenate an empty space to the beginning of your returned value.

```js
assert.match(padRow(1, 1), /^\s/);
```

You should concatenate an empty space to the end of your returned value.

```js
assert.match(padRow(1, 1), /\s$/);
```

Your `padRow()` function should return the repeated `character` series with a space before and after the series.

```js
assert.equal(padRow(1, 1), " # ");
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
const character = "#";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];

--fcc-editable-region--
function padRow(rowNumber, rowCount) {
  return character.repeat(rowNumber);
}
--fcc-editable-region--

for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
  rows.push(padRow(i + 1, count));
}

let result = ""

for (const row of rows) {
  result = result + "\n" + row;
}

console.log(result);
```
