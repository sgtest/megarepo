AUDIO REFERENCE:
Brian: When dealing with functions, start by looking at the function's signature. It can provide information about the function's name, parameters, and return type.
-->

# --description--

The possessive `'s` shows something belongs to someone or something, like in `Brian's book`, meaning the book belongs to Brian.

`Dealing` means managing or handling something. For example, `When dealing with homework, it's important to be focused.`

A `function's signature` in programming is like an ID card for a function. It tells you the function's name, what it needs (parameters), and what it gives back (`return type`).

The `return type` of a function is what the function gives back after it runs, like a vending machine returning a soda after you put in money.
