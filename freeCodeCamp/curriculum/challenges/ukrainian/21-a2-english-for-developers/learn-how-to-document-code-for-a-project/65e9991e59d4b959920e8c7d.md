# --question--

## --text--

When should Sophie reference issues in her commit messages, and why?

## --answers--

When working on any task, to make the messages longer

### --feedback--

The focus isn't on making messages longer but on providing specific information for tasks related to an issue.

---

Only when working on tasks related to an issue, to help track progress and understand changes

---

Always, in every task she works

### --feedback--

Brian specifically mentions referencing issues when the task is related to one, not always.

---

When she completes a task, to show she has finished it

### --feedback--

Referencing issues is meant for context and tracking progress, not just to indicate task completion.
