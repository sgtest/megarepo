# --description--

Understanding the past tense `had` and its use in the phrase `I've had` is crucial. `Had` is the past tense and past participle of `have`. When used as `I've had`, it indicates something that happened in the past and has relevance to the present. For example, `I've had breakfast` implies the person ate breakfast earlier, and it affects their current state.
