# --description--

`To run into` often means to meet someone unexpectedly or to encounter a problem. For example, `I ran into my friend at the store` means you met your friend without planning to.

The expression `run into the same problem` specifically refers to facing the same difficulty or issue again. It's a way to talk about facing a repeated challenge, especially one that you have experienced before and want to avoid.

For example, if a software crashes due to a specific bug, and you fix it, you would document the solution to ensure you don't `run into the same problem` in the future.
