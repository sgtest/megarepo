# --description--

In conversations, people often use phrases like `you know what` not to ask a real question but to share something important. It's like saying, `Listen, I have something to tell you.`

For example, if someone says, `You know what? I love ice cream,` they don't expect you to guess; they are just excited to tell you about their love for ice cream.
