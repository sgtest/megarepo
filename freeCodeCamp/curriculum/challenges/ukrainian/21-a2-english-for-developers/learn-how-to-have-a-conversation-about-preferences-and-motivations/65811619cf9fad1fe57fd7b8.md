# --description--

Verbs ending in `-ing` can be gerunds or present participles.

A **gerund** acts like a noun and is used to talk about the activity itself. For example, in `Coding is fun`, `Coding` is a gerund because it's the subject of the sentence, just like a noun.

The **present continuous tense** is formed using the verb `to be` and a present participle to describe actions that are happening right now. For example, in `She is coding`, `is coding` is in the present continuous tense because it shows what she is doing at this moment.
