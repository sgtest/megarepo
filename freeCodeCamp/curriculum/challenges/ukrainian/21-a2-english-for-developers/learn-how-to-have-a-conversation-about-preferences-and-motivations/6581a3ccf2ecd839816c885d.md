<!--
AUDIO REFERENCE:
Tom: You're right, Alice. Dealing with office politics is never fun. Another thing that gets to me is having too many meetings. Sometimes, it feels like we're meeting for no reason, and it's hard to find time to actually work on projects.

Alice: I hear you, Tom. Sitting in meetings for hours can be discouraging.
