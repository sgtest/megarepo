# --description--

`To admit` means to say something is true, especially something you would prefer not to. For example, if you say, `I admit I forgot to save my work,` you're saying it's true that you didn't save your work, even though it's not a good situation.

`Amount` refers to how much there is of something. Like when you talk about the `amount` of sugar in a cake, you're talking about how much sugar is used to make it.
