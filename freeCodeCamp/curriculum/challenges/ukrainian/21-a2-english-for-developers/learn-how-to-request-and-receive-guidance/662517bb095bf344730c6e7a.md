# --description--

`Loops` in programming refer to instructions that repeat until a certain condition is met. They are used to run the same code multiple times.

`When` is a word used to refer to the time at which something happens. It's often used in questions about timing or conditions.

`To approach` means to deal with something or to start to consider a problem in a particular way. In problem-solving, it's about the method or strategy used to tackle a challenge.
