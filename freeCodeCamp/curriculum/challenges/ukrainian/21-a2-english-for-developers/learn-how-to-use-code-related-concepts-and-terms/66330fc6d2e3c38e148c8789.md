# --description--

You've already learned about demonstrative pronouns like `this`, `that`, `these` and `those`. Remember to use them to refer to specific things or people, considering their proximity in time or space.

The genitive case, often indicated by an apostrophe and `s` (like `function's`), is used to show possession or belonging, typically for people or objects. It tells people that something belongs to or is a part of something else.

The word `purpose` refers to the reason why something is done or used, or why something exists. For example, `The purpose of a clock is to tell time.`
