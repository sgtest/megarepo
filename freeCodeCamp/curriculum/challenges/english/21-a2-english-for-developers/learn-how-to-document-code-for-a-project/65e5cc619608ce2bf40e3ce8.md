# --description--

In this task, you'll learn about phrases like `Did you get it?`, `Got it,` and `What else?` These phrases are common in English conversations. `Did you get it?` is a question asking if someone understood something. `Got it` is a short way of saying `I understood.` `What else?` is used to ask for additional information or items.

For example, in a meeting, someone might say, `Did you get it?` and you can reply, `Got it, what else do we need to discuss?`
