# --description--

`To grasp` is a verb meaning to understand something. It changes to `grasping` after words like `is` or `am` to describe the action that is happening now. For example, `She is grasping the concept` means she is currently understanding the concept.

When someone says `great job grasping`, it means "you did a very good job at understanding something". It's a way of praising someone for learning something, especially if it was challenging. 

For example, if you start understanding how to use a computer and someone says, `Great job grasping how to use the computer!` They mean you are doing well at learning something new.
