# --description--

A `quarter` divides the year into four equal parts, each consisting of three months. 

The `first quarter` (Q1) covers January to March, the `second quarter` (Q2) spans April to June, the `third quarter` (Q3) includes July to September, and the `fourth quarter` (Q4) encompasses October to December.

For example, in business, a company might review its sales at the end of each `quarter`. A tech team might have a goal to release a new software update by the end of Q2.
