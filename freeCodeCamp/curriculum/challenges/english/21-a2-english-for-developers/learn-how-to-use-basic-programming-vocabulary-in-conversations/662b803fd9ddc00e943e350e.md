# --description--

An `assignment operator` in programming is used to assign a value to a variable. In many programming languages, including Python, the `assignment operator` is represented by the `=` symbol. It tells the computer to store the value on the right side of the `=` into the variable named on the left side. For example, `number = 10` assigns the value `10` to the variable `number`.
