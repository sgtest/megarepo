Brian: I see. Did you enjoy your time there, even if it wasn't entirely tech-focused?

# --description--

When you want to ask someone about their experiences related to a past event, you can say `Did you enjoy...?` 

This is a simple way to ask about someone's preferences or satisfaction. 

`Even if` is used to introduce a condition or situation that contrasts with the main part of the question or statement. It helps to provide more context or specify conditions under which something occurred or was felt.

For example, `Did you enjoy your vacation, even if it rained every day?` adds a contrasting condition to the question about the vacation.
