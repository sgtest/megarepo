# --description--

The word `especially` is used to emphasize one person or thing over all others. It's often used to indicate that something applies more strongly to one item compared to others. For example, `I like many sports, especially basketball.` This indicates a particular preference for basketball over other sports.

`Especially useful` points to something being of great help in specific contexts. For instance, A multi-tool is `especially useful` for camping, as it provides various functions beneficial for outdoor activities, proving to be more useful than carrying separate tools.
