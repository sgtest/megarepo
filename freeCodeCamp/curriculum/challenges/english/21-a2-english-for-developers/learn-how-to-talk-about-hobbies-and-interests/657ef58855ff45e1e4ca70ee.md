# --description--

In this dialogue, Sarah uses `Have I told you` to ask Tom in an engaging way if she has previously mentioned something about herself. 

Using `Have I told you` is a way to connect the past with the present, as if Sarah is trying to recall if she has shared her passion for sci-fi with Tom before. 

This phrase is a great example of how the Present Perfect Tense is used to talk about actions that occurred at an unspecified time before now.
