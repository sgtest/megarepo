# --description--

`Most` is used to refer to the greatest in amount or degree. For example, `She spends most of her time reading.` This means she spends the greater part of her time reading compared to other activities.

`Mostly`, on the other hand, means mainly or for the most part. It's used when something is true or applies to a great extent but not entirely. For instance, `The sky is mostly clear tonight.` This suggests that while there may be a few clouds, the majority of the sky is clear.
