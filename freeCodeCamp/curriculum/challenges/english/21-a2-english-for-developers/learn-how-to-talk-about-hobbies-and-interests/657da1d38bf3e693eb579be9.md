# --description--

To ask questions in the Present Perfect Continuous Tense, you change the order of the words in a sentence. You start with `have` or `has`, then `been`, and then the `-ing` form of the main verb. 

For example, if you want to ask someone if they have been doing something for a while, you can say, `Have you been coding for three hours?` 

Here, you start with `Have`, then `you` (the person you are asking), `been`, and `coding`. This tense is used for actions that started in the past and are still happening now.
