# --description--

`Daily tasks` refer to the activities or work that someone needs to do every day. These can vary depending on the person's job or routine.

For example, `Checking emails and attending meetings are part of my daily tasks at work` means these activities are what the person does regularly, every day, as part of their job.

`Daily` means something that happens every day. Similarly, `monthly` means something that happens once a month, and `yearly` means something that happens once a year.
