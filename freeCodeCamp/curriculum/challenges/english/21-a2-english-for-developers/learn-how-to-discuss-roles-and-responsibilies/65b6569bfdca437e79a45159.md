AUDIO REFERENCE:
Bob: Word is that she’s strict but fair.
-->

# --description--

`Strict` means someone enforces rules strongly. For example, `My teacher is strict about homework deadlines.` It means the teacher insists that everyone hands in their homework on time.

`Fair` means treating everyone equally and justly. For example, `The judge was fair in her decision`, meaning the judge made a decision based on the rules and without favoritism.

`But` is a word used to connect two ideas that might seem opposite or different. It shows contrast. For example, `I like apples but not oranges.` This statement shows a preference for apples over oranges.
