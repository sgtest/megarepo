# --description--

The Present Perfect Tense is formed with `have` or `has` plus the past participle of a verb. For example, for irregular verb `meet`, its past participle is `met`. This tense is used to talk about experiences or actions from the past that still matter now.

Use `have` with the pronouns `I`, `you`, `we`, and `they`, and use `has` with `he`, `she`, and `it`.

The word `yet` is often used in questions in the Present Perfect Tense to inquire if something has happened up to now.
