<!--
AUDIO REFERENCE:
Alice: I've seen her a couple of times.
-->

# --description--

The phrase `I've seen` uses the present perfect tense. `Seen` is the past participle form of `see`.

`A couple of times` means it has happened a few times. It's a way to say something occurred more than once but not many times.

# --question--

## --text--

What does Alice say about her experience?

## --answers--

She has seen her a few times before now.

---

She sees her every day.

### --feedback--

Alice's statement implies the meetings were a few times, not a daily occurrence.

---

She has never seen her.

### --feedback--

Alice clearly states she has seen her, which contradicts the option of never seeing her.

---

She saw her once.

### --feedback--

`A couple of times` indicates it was more than once, so this option is too limited.
