# --description--

The words `super` and `pretty` are adverbs used to emphasize the degree of something.

`Super` means very or extremely. For example, `This book is super interesting` means the book is very interesting. 

`Pretty` as an adverb is used to mean "quite" or "rather". It's a way to say that something is to a large degree, but not extremely. For example, if you say `It's pretty cold outside`, you mean it's quite cold, but not extremely cold.
