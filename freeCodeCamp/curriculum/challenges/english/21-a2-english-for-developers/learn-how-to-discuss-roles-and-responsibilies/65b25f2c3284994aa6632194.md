It can be used with `for` followed by a period of time or `since` followed by a specific starting point in time to highlight the duration or how long the action happens.

Examples:

`We have been studying English for three years.` This means we started studying English three years ago and are still studying it now.

`He has been playing the guitar since he was ten.` This means he started playing the guitar when he was ten years old and continues to play it.
