# --description--

Remember, the present perfect tense, formed with `have` or `has` plus the past participle of a verb, is used to describe actions or states that occurred at an unspecified time before now. The focus is on the result of the action, not the specific time it occurred.

# --question--

## --text--

What does `have achieved` in Sarah's statement imply about the team's work?

## --answers--

The team has successfully reached goals or completed tasks recently.

---

The team will achieve their goals in the future.

### --feedback--

This option is incorrect because `have achieved` refers to accomplishments already made, not future goals.

---

The team had goals but did not achieve them.

### --feedback--

`Have achieved` indicates successful accomplishment, not failure to achieve goals.

---

The team is planning to start working soon.

The use of `have achieved` implies that the work has already been done, not just planned.
