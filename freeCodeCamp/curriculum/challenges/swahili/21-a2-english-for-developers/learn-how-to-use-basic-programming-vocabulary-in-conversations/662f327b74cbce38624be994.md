# --description--

The phrase `no worries` is a casual expression used to reassure someone that everything is okay and they should not be concerned. It can be used to respond to a thank you, to dismiss an apology, or to reassure someone that a problem is not serious.

For example, when your friend accidentally spills a drink and starts to apologize, you may say `no worries! It's just water, and it'll dry up quickly` to make the friend feel better.
