<!-- (Audio) Sophie: I didn't study computer science at university, but I majored in electrical engineering. -->

# --description--

You're already familiar with `wasn't` and `weren't` for past simple negative. Now, let's explore `didn't`, a contraction of `did not`. It's used with the base form of verbs (the infinitive without `to`) to express that an action did not happen in the past. For example, `didn't go` means the action of going did not occur.

# --question--

## --text--

If we say in English that `Sophie didn't study computer science`, what could you understand from this sentence?

## --answers--

Sophie enjoyed the computer science degree

### --feedback--

Using `didn't` suggests she did not study it, contradicting the idea of enjoying it.

---

Computer science is not something Sophie studied in college

---

Sophie always studies computer science

### --feedback--

This expression refers to a regular habit, not a specific event in the past.

---

Sophie is looking forward to studying computer science

### --feedback--

This option is about future anticipation.
