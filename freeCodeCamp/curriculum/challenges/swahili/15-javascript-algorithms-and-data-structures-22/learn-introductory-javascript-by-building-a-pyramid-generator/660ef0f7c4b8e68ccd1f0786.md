# --description--

JavaScript has seven primitive data types, with `String` being one of them. In JavaScript, a <dfn>string</dfn> represents a sequence of characters and can be enclosed in either single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.

Note that strings are <dfn>immutable</dfn>, which means once they are created, they cannot be changed. The variable can still be reassigned another value.

Change your `"Hello"` string to use single quotes.

# --hints--

You should not have double quotes in your code.

```js
assert.notMatch(code, /"/);
```

You should use single quotes for your `"Hello"` string.

```js
assert.match(code, /'Hello'/);
```

You should still use `let` in your code.

```js
assert.match(code, /let/);
```

You should still declare a `character` variable.

```js
assert.match(code, /let\s+character/);
```

Your `character` variable should still have the string `"Hello"` for its value.

```js
assert.equal(character, "Hello");
```
